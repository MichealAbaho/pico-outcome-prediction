    "AB": "Background: Although community engagement has been promoted as a strategy for health systems strengthening, there is need for more evidence for effectiveness of this approach. We describe an operations research (OR) Study and assessment of one form of community engagement, the development and implementation of a participatory community-based health information system (PCBHIS), in slum communities in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Methods: A child survival project was implemented in 10 slum communities, which were then randomly allocated to intervention (PCBHIS) and comparison areas. In the 5 PCBHIS communities, the findings from monthly reports submitted by community health workers (CHWs) and verbal autopsy findings for deaths of children who died before reaching 5 years of age, were processed and shared at bimonthly meetings in each community. These meetings, called Community Health Data Review (CHDR) meetings, were attended by community leaders, including members of the Ward Development Committee (WDC) and Health Management Committee (HMC), by the CHW Peer Supervisors, and by representatives of the Peripheral Health Unit. Following a review of the information, attendees proposed actions to strengthen community-based health services in their community. These meetings were held over a period of 20 months from July 2015 to March 2017. At baseline and endline, knowledge, practice and coverage (KPC) surveys measured household health-related behaviors and care-seeking behaviors. The capacity of HMCs and WDCs to engage with the local health system was also measured at baseline and endline. Reports of CHW household contact and assessments of CHW quality were obtained in the endline KPC household survey, and household contacts measured in monthly submitted reports were also tabulated. Results: The self-assessment scores of WDCs' capacity to fulfil their roles improved more in the intervention than in the comparison area for all six components, but for only 1 of the 6 was the improvement statistically significant (monthly and quarterly meetings in which Peer Supervisor and/or CHW supervision was an agenda item). The scores for the HMCs improved less in the intervention area than in the comparison area for all six components, but none of these differences were statistically significant. Topics of discussion in CHDRs focused primarily on CHW functionality. All three indicators of CHW functioning (as measured by reports submitted from CHWs) improved more in the intervention area relative to the comparison area, with 2 out of 3 measures of improvement reaching statistical significance. Five of 7 household behaviors judged to be amenable to promotion by CHWs improved more in the intervention area than in the comparison area, and 2 out of the 5 were statistically significant (feeding colostrum and appropriate infant and young child feeding). Four of the 6 care-seeking behaviors judged to be amenable to promotion by CHWs improved more in the intervention area than in the comparison area, and 1 was statistically significant (treatment of diarrhea with ORS and zinc). None of the findings that favored the comparison area were statistically significant. Conclusions: This study was implemented in challenging circumstances. The OR Study intervention was delayed because of interruptions in finalizing the national CHW policy, two separate cholera epidemics, and the Ebola epidemic lasting more than 2 years. Weaknesses in the CHW intervention severely limited the extent to which the PCBHIS could be used to observe trends in mortality and morbidity. Nonetheless, the positive results achieved in the area of functionality of the CHW intervention and community structure capacity are encouraging. Results suggest there is value in further methodologically rigorous investigations into improving community-based health system functioning through a similar approach to community engagement.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND/AIM: The analysis of prognostic factors is important to identify determinants of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined baseline characteristics associated with DFS and OS among 757 patients with resected, histologically proven, MAGE-A3-positive Stage IB-IIIA NSCLC assigned to placebo in the MAGRIT study (NCT00480025). We explored characteristics of NSCLC that could predict DFS and OS using Cox regression models. RESULTS: The multivariate analysis showed that lower nodal stage, the presence of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a broader surgical resection in patients with SCC, and being female with non-SCC were significantly associated with longer DFS. Lower nodal stage and smaller tumor size were significantly associated with an improved OS. Compared to Other International, enrollment in East Asia was associated with an improved OS in patients with non-SCC. CONCLUSION: This is the first prognostic factor analysis in NSCLC performed on data from a large prospective study. These results confirm retrospective studies and add that histopathology subtype is a strong determinant of DFS in resected MAGE-A3-positive NSCLC.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Our hypothesis was that rectus sheath block (RSB) analgesia could enhance satisfaction following midline laparotomy in patients with benign disease and cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Initially, 56 patients were randomized into four groups; control group (n=12), single-dose (n=16), repeated-dose (n=12) and continuous infusion (n=16) RSB analgesia groups. The plasma concentrations of the NT marker were measured just before, immediately after and 24 h after operation. Patient satisfaction at 24 h postoperatively was filed on a 11-point numeric rating scale (SFS24; 0=fully unsatisfied; 10=fully satisfied). RESULTS: The RSB analgesia significantly enhanced the SFS24 scores in the study groups (p=0.001). The median plasma NT concentrations (pg/ml) following surgery (POP1) were significantly lower in patients with cancer versus patients with benign disease (5.3 vs. 7.6, p=0.008). Jitter plots of the individual SFS24 values versus plasma NT concentrations were significantly correlated in benign and cancer patients (r=-0.284, p=0.028). CONCLUSION: The RSB analgesia could significantly enhance patient satisfaction following midline laparotomy. Plasma NT concentrations versus patient satisfaction following surgery are significantly correlated in benign disease and cancer.",

METHODS: This pilot randomized controlled trial compared BZSF as an adjunctive therapy to ceftriaxone with ceftriaxone alone for Chinese female patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea. A total of 40 eligible patients were randomly allocated to a treatment group (received BZSF and ceftriaxone) or a control group (received ceftriaxone alone). All patients in both groups were treated for a total of 10 days. The primary outcome included bacteriological cure. It was assessed by the eradication of urogenital gonorrhea at any site cultured after taken the study medications. The secondary outcome was clinical response. For the safety assessment, adverse events were recorded during the study period. RESULTS: After treatment, patients in both groups achieved promising effectiveness. However, no significant differences in bacteriological cure (P = .34), clinical response (P = .11), and safety were found between 2 groups. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study showed that BZSF as an adjunctive therapy to ceftriaxone may be not superior to the ceftriaxone alone for Chinese female patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea after 10 days treatment.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine (Dex), as an adjuvant, has been reported to prolong the duration of spinal analgesia when adding to local anesthetic. We hypothesized that Dex could enhance the efficiency of intrathecal bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia in cesarean section. The aim of his study is to test our hypothesis that 5 mug Dex could enhance the efficiency of intrathecal bupivacaine and reduce the dose requirement of spinal bupivacaine for patients undergoing cesarean section. METHODS: Ninety patients with ASA I or II, who underwent cesarean section, were randomized into 2 groups: group D (bupivacaine + 5 mug Dex) and group C (bupivacaine + the same volume of saline). The subsequent dose of spinal bupivacaine was determined by the improved up-down allocation method. The initial dose of bupivacaine in the 2 groups was 4 mg, and the subsequent dose for the following patient was depended on the probability of the current dose. ED95 of spinal bupivacaine was calculated using logistic regression model. RESULTS: The ED95 and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of spinal hyperbaric bupivacaine in group D and group C were 7.4 mg (95% CI, 5.6-12.4 mg) and 11.0 mg (95% CI, 4.4-56.8 mg), respectively. The duration of sensory block was 120.5 +/- 37.0 minutes in Dex group and 70.5 +/- 34.5 minutes in Control group, respectively (P < .05). The duration of analgesia was 230.5 +/- 40.5 minutes in Dex group and 145.1 +/- 28.5 minutes in Control group, respectively (P < .001). The consumption of postoperative rescued sufentanil was significantly lower in Dex group than in the Control group (56.3 +/- 9.4 vs 65.9 +/- 10.7 mug). There was not significantly different in the patient satisfaction of analgesia, incidence of side effects, neonatal outcomes and neurological deficit between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Intrathecal 5 mug Dex enhances the efficacy of spinal bupivacaine by 24% in patients undergoing cesarean section with spinal anesthesia. No additional side effect was observed by adding spinal Dex.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to observe the feasibility and effect of cornea slice acquired from femtosecond laser surgery, small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) as patch graft for the prevention of drainage tube exposure and to compare with the sclera. METHODS: The research is a prospective comparative randomized study. Patients who received Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation surgery from August 2015 to January 2017 at the Xiamen Eye Center were randomly divided into 2 groups. Group A (corneal group) included 131 cases (135 eyes), receiving the 3 layers of allogeneic cornea slices as graft. Group B (scleral group) included 124 cases (127 eyes), using the sclera as allograft. The appearance, graft, conjunctiva melting, and tube exposure were the primary observation points. RESULTS: After followed up for 6 to 20 months, a thinner appearance was seen in 3 eyes (2.2%) in the corneal graft group and 7 eyes (5.5%) in the scleral group. Conjunctiva melted and drainage tube exposed in 0 eyes (0%) in the corneal graft group and 2 eyes (1.6%) in the scleral group. One eye needed repair surgery. There was no statistical difference between the 2 groups (P > .05). After surgery, the intraocular pressure was reduced significantly in both groups (P < .05). The white sclera slice could be seen under the conjunctiva, thereby affecting the cosmetic appearance. CONCLUSION: The cornea slice acquired from SMILE surgery can effectively prevent drainage tube exposure. Moreover, it is easy to acquire, safe, and cheaper, giving the patient a better cosmetic appearance.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: The present study aimed to investigate the serum levels of adiponectin (APN) and adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) combined with macrovascular complications (MVC), as well as their correlation with clinical parameters. METHODS: A total of 60 T2DM patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of MVC: T2DM + MVC group (n=30) and T2DM group (n=30). Additionally, 30 healthy people were selected as control group (NC group). Clinical data and biological parameters were detected and recorded. T test was performed to compare the differences between two groups, and the results were corrected using Bonferroni method. Meanwhile, the correlation analysis and multiple stepwise regression analysis were used to analyze the association of APN and AdipoR1 with clinical factors. RESULTS: The levels of APN and AdipoR1 were significantly decreased in T2DM group and T2DM + MVC group compared with NC group, with the lowest value in T2DM + MVC group (all P<0.01). Serum APN levels were positively correlated with FINS and TG (r = 0.412, 0.316, respectively; both P<0.05), and negatively correlated with SBP, DBP and LDL-C (r = -0.292, -0.383, -0.334, respectively; all P<0.05). Serum levels of AdipoR1 were positively correlated with APN (r = 0.726, P<0.01), and negatively correlated with BMI, SBP, DBP, FBG, TC and LDL-C (r = -0.440, -0.446, -0.374, -0.444, -0.344, -0.709, respectively; all P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Serum levels of APN and AdipoR1 are significantly lower in T2DM group and T2DM + MVC group, showing lowest value in T2DM + MVC group. APN and AdipoR1 levels may influence glucose and lipid metabolism in T2DM patients.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide, and the importance of tubular injury has been highlighted in recent years. However, the underlying mechanisms and effective therapeutic targets are still unclear. In this study, we investigated mtDNA, mitochondrial dynamics, function and metabolic pathways to determine if mitochondrial damage plays a critical role in the development of tubular injury in DKD patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among healthy controls (HCs, n = 65), diabetes patients without kidney disease (DCs, n = 48) and DKD patients (n = 60). Serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and kidney biopsy specimens were obtained from participants. Metabolomics was employed to investigate cellular metabolism. RESULTS: DKD patients had decreased mtDNA copy numbers and increased mtDNA damage compared to DCs. Mitochondrial fragmentation was specifically presented in tubules, but not in podocytes of DKD patients. The accumulation of damaged mtDNA and fragmented mitochondria resulted in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, activation of apoptosis and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) in tubules and PBMCs. Furthermore, glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was perturbed, and increased dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and decreased succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) respectively in these two metabolic pathways were identified as potential biomarkers for tubular injury in DKD. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that mitochondrial damage could be the hallmark of tubular injury in DKD patients, and this would provide a novel and attractive therapeutic target to improve this disease.",

    "AB": "AIMS: Adductor canal block (ACB) has emerged as an alternative to femoral nerve block (FNB) for analgesia after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The optimal duration of maintenance of the ACB is still questionable. The purpose of this study was to compare the analgesic benefits and physiotherapy (PT) outcomes of single-shot ACB to two different regimens of infusion of the continuous ACB, 24-hour and 48-hour infusion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, unblinded study. A total of 159 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I to III patients scheduled for primary TKA were randomized to one of three study groups. Three patients did not complete the study, leaving 156 patients for final analysis. Group A (n = 53) was the single-shot group (16 female patients and 37 male patients with a mean age of 63.9 years (sd 9.6)), group B (n = 51) was the 24-hour infusion group (22 female patients and 29 male patients with a mean age of 66.5 years (sd 8.5)), and group C (n = 52) was the 48-hour infusion group (18 female patients and 34 male patients with a mean age of 62.2 years (sd 8.7)). Pain scores, opioid requirements, PT test results, and patient-reported outcome instruments were compared between the three groups. RESULTS: The proportion of patients reporting severe pain, defined as a pain score of between 7 and 10, on postoperative day number 2 (POD 2) were 21% for the single-shot group, 14% for the 24-hour block group, and 12% for the 48-hour block group (p = 0.05). Cumulative opioid requirements after 48 hours were similar between the groups. Functional outcomes were similar in all three groups in POD 1 and POD 2. CONCLUSION: There was no clear benefit of the 24-hour or 48-hour infusions over the single-shot ACB for the primary endpoint of the study. Otherwise, there were marginal benefits for keeping the indwelling catheter for 48 hours in terms of reducing the number of patients with moderate pain and improving the quality of pain management. However, all three groups had similar opioid usage, length of hospital stay, and functional outcomes. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: A high-fidelity task simulator for cricothyroidotomy was created using data from a 3-dimensional (3D) computed tomography scan using a 3D printer. We hypothesized that this high-fidelity cricothyroidotomy simulator results in increased proficiency for needle cricothyroidotomy compared with conventional simulators. METHODS: Cricothyroidotomy-naive residents were recruited and randomly assigned to 2 groups, including simulation training with a conventional simulator (Group C) and with a high-fidelity simulator (Group 3D). After simulation training, participants performed cricothyroidotomy using an ex vivo porcine larynx fitted with an endoscope to record the procedure. The primary outcomes were success rate and procedure time. The secondary outcome was a subjective measure of the similarity of the simulator to the porcine larynx. RESULTS: Fifty-two residents participated in the study (Group C: n = 27, Group 3D: n = 25). There was no significant difference in the success rate or procedure time between the 2 groups (success rate: P = .24, procedure time: P = .34). There was no significant difference in the similarity of the simulators to the porcine larynx (P = .81). CONCLUSION: We developed a high-fidelity simulator for cricothyroidotomy from 3D computed tomography data using a 3D printer. This anatomically high-fidelity simulator did not have any advantages compared with conventional dry simulators.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial, we aimed to explore the effectiveness of trigger point dry needling in patients with chronic tension-type headache in reducing headache frequency, intensity and duration, and improvement of health-related quality of life. METHODS: The 168 patients in 2 neurology clinics with chronic tension-type headache. The participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups for dry needling or sham dry needling, delivered in 3 sessions a week for 2 weeks. The 160 patients fulfilled the study requirements. The dry needling was applied in active trigger points located in the musculature of the head and the neck. The patients received dry needling using sterile stainless-steel acupuncture needles of 0.25 x 40 mm and 0.25 x 25 mm dimensions. The sham dry needling procedure was applied into the adipose tissue located at any area where an active trigger point was absent. The primary outcome measurement was the headache intensity. Secondary outcomes were frequency and duration of headache, and quality of life, assessed by the Short Form-36. All outcomes were measured at baseline, at the end of 2-week, and 1-month follow-up period. RESULTS: In the dry needling group, intensity, frequency and duration of headache, and the scores of Short Form-36 subscales were significantly improved after treatment (P < .05). In the dry needling group, all the effect sizes for headache variables were large. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this clinical trial suggest that trigger point dry needling in patients with chronic tension-type headache is effective and safe in reducing headache intensity, frequency and duration, and increasing health-related quality of life.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Complications related to concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) such as acute radiation-induced esophagitis (ARIE) may cause significant morbidity and unplanned treatment delays in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We designed a prospective randomized study to assess the impact of glutamine (GLN) supplementation in preventing CCRT-induced toxicities of advanced NSCLC patients. METHODS: From September 2014 to September 2015, 60 patients diagnosed with NSCLC were included to the study. Thirty patients (50%) received prophylactic powdered GLN orally at a dose of 10 g/8 h. The prescribed radiation dose to the planning target volume was 30 Gy in 2-Gy fractions. The endpoints were radiation-induced esophagitis, mucositis, body weight loss, overall survival and progression-free survival. RESULTS: The 60 patients with NSCLC included 42 men and 18 women with a mean age +/- standard deviation of 60.3 years +/- 18.2 (range, 44-78 years).At a median follow-up of 26.4 months (range 10.4-32.2), all patients tolerated GLN well. A administration of GLN was associated with a decrease in the incidence of grade 2 or 3 ARIE (6.7% vs 53.4% for Gln+ vs Gln-; P = .004). GLN supplementation appeared to significantly delay ARIE onset for 5.8 days (18.2 days vs 12.4 days; P = .027) and reduced incidence of weight loss (20% vs 73.3%; P = .01). DISCUSSION: Our study suggests a beneficial effect of oral glutamine supplementation for the prevention from radiation-induced injury and body weight loss in advanced NSCLC patients who receiving CCRT.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a serious lung disease for individuals in middle age and especially in old people. The study was aimed to observe the curative effect of device-guided rehabilitation on respiratory functions in stable COPD patients. METHODS: Sixty-seven stable COPD patients were enrolled and assigned to the experiment group (n = 36) and the control group (n = 31). The conventional pulmonary rehabilitation treatments, including pursed lips breathing (PLB) and abdominal breathing training, were applied in the control group. Respiratory muscle training of the experiment group was performed using the respiratory endurance training device combined with traditional techniques. Both groups were assessed by 6-minute walk test (6MWT), COPD assessment test (CAT), body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity (BODE) index. Besides, the pulmonary function (FVC%, FEVl%) were measured at 6 months before and after treatment. RESULTS: After treatment, the 6MWT, CAT, BODE index were significantly increased compared with pre-treatment in both groups (P < .01), but not FVC% and FEVl%. Compared with the control group, the combination therapy in the experiment group could significantly improve the 6MWT (P = .0094), CAT (P = .0071) and BODE index (P = .0064) as well as the changes of 6MWT (P < .01), CAT (P < .01), and BODE index (P < .01) before and after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The traditional respiratory training combined with device-guided pulmonary rehabilitation can improve the respiratory muscle function and athletic ability in stable COPD patients.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Systematic pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy has been widely used in the surgical treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer, although supporting evidence from randomized clinical trials has been limited. METHODS: We intraoperatively randomly assigned patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIB through IV) who had undergone macroscopically complete resection and had normal lymph nodes both before and during surgery to either undergo or not undergo lymphadenectomy. All centers had to qualify with regard to surgical skills before participation in the trial. The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 647 patients underwent randomization from December 2008 through January 2012, were assigned to undergo lymphadenectomy (323 patients) or not undergo lymphadenectomy (324), and were included in the analysis. Among patients who underwent lymphadenectomy, the median number of removed nodes was 57 (35 pelvic and 22 paraaortic nodes). The median overall survival was 69.2 months in the no-lymphadenectomy group and 65.5 months in the lymphadenectomy group (hazard ratio for death in the lymphadenectomy group, 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 1.34; P = 0.65), and median progression-free survival was 25.5 months in both groups (hazard ratio for progression or death in the lymphadenectomy group, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.34; P = 0.29). Serious postoperative complications occurred more frequently in the lymphadenectomy group (e.g., incidence of repeat laparotomy, 12.4% vs. 6.5% [P = 0.01]; mortality within 60 days after surgery, 3.1% vs. 0.9% [P = 0.049]). CONCLUSIONS: Systematic pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer who had undergone intraabdominal macroscopically complete resection and had normal lymph nodes both before and during surgery was not associated with longer overall or progression-free survival than no lymphadenectomy and was associated with a higher incidence of postoperative complications.

    "AB": "Background Intravenous sufentanil-midazolam and inhalational sevoflurane are widely used for anesthetic induction in children undergoing cardiac surgery. However, knowledge about their effects on hemodynamics and cardiac efficiency remains limited due largely to the lack of direct monitoring method. We used minimally invasive technique pressure recording analytical method (PRAM) to directly monitor hemodynamics and cardiac efficiency and compared the effects of the two anesthetic regimens in children undergoing ventricular septal defect repair. Methods Forty-Four children (2.3+/-0.9 years) were randomly divided into two groups to receive either intravenous sufentanil (1 mug/kg) and midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) (Group SM) or 2.0 minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) sevoflurane (Group S) to complete induction after sedation was obtained with 2.0 MAC sevoflurane. Systemic hemodynamic data recorded by PRAM included heart rate (HR), systolic (SBP) and mean (MBP) blood pressure, stroke volume index (SVI), cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), the maximal slope of systolic upstroke (dp/dtmax) and cardiac cycle efficiency (CCE) after sedation obtained, 1, 2, 5 min after induction achieved, 1, 2, 5 and 10 min after intubation. Results HR, SVRI showed a decrease in Group SM but an increase in Group S (Ptime*group<0.0001) in the study period. SVI and CCE showed an increase in Group SM but a decrease in Group S (Ptime*group<0.0001). SBP, MBP and CI were related to time after polynomial transformation, and showed an increase after intubation in Group SM but a decrease in Group S (Ptime2*group<0.0001). Conclusion PRAM provides meaningful and direct monitoring of hemodynamics and cardiac efficiency during the dynamic period of anesthetic induction in children undergoing cardiac surgery. As compared to inhalational sevoflurane, intravenous sufentanil-midazolam exerts more favorable effects on systemic hemodynamics and cardiac efficiency during anesthetic induction in this group of patients.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: The increasing multidrug resistance among gram-negative uropathogens necessitates new treatments for serious infections. Plazomicin is an aminoglycoside with bactericidal activity against multidrug-resistant (including carbapenem-resistant) Enterobacteriaceae. METHODS: We randomly assigned 609 patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), including acute pyelonephritis, in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous plazomicin (15 mg per kilogram of body weight once daily) or meropenem (1 g every 8 hours), with optional oral step-down therapy after at least 4 days of intravenous therapy, for a total of 7 to 10 days of therapy. The primary objective was to show the noninferiority of plazomicin to meropenem in the treatment of complicated UTIs, including acute pyelonephritis, with a noninferiority margin of 15 percentage points. The primary end points were composite cure (clinical cure and microbiologic eradication) at day 5 and at the test-of-cure visit (15 to 19 days after initiation of therapy) in the microbiologic modified intention-to-treat population. RESULTS: Plazomicin was noninferior to meropenem with respect to the primary efficacy end points. At day 5, composite cure was observed in 88.0% of the patients (168 of 191 patients) in the plazomicin group and in 91.4% (180 of 197 patients) in the meropenem group (difference, -3.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -10.0 to 3.1). At the test-of-cure visit, composite cure was observed in 81.7% (156 of 191 patients) and 70.1% (138 of 197 patients), respectively (difference, 11.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.7 to 20.3). At the test-of-cure visit, a higher percentage of patients in the plazomicin group than in the meropenem group were found to have microbiologic eradication, including eradication of Enterobacteriaceae that were not susceptible to aminoglycosides (78.8% vs. 68.6%) and Enterobacteriaceae that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (82.4% vs. 75.0%). At late follow-up (24 to 32 days after initiation of therapy), fewer patients in the plazomicin group than in the meropenem group had microbiologic recurrence (3.7% vs. 8.1%) or clinical relapse (1.6% vs. 7.1%). Increases in serum creatinine levels of 0.5 mg or more per deciliter (>/=40 mumol per liter) above baseline occurred in 7.0% of patients in the plazomicin group and in 4.0% in the meropenem group. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily plazomicin was noninferior to meropenem for the treatment of complicated UTIs and acute pyelonephritis caused by Enterobacteriaceae, including multidrug-resistant strains.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Ambulatory patients receiving systemic cancer therapy are at varying risk for venous thromboembolism. However, the benefit of thromboprophylaxis in these patients is uncertain. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized trial involving high-risk ambulatory patients with cancer (Khorana score of >/=2, on a scale from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of venous thromboembolism), we randomly assigned patients without deep-vein thrombosis at screening to receive rivaroxaban (at a dose of 10 mg) or placebo daily for up to 180 days, with screening every 8 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of objectively confirmed proximal deep-vein thrombosis in a lower limb, pulmonary embolism, symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis in an upper limb or distal deep-vein thrombosis in a lower limb, and death from venous thromboembolism and was assessed up to day 180. In a prespecified supportive analysis involving the same population, the same end point was assessed during the intervention period (first receipt of trial agent to last dose plus 2 days). The primary safety end point was major bleeding. RESULTS: Of 1080 enrolled patients, 49 (4.5%) had thrombosis at screening and did not undergo randomization. Of the 841 patients who underwent randomization, the primary end point occurred in 25 of 420 patients (6.0%) in the rivaroxaban group and in 37 of 421 (8.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40 to 1.09; P = 0.10) in the period up to day 180. In the prespecified intervention-period analysis, the primary end point occurred in 11 patients (2.6%) in the rivaroxaban group and in 27 (6.4%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.80). Major bleeding occurred in 8 of 405 patients (2.0%) in the rivaroxaban group and in 4 of 404 (1.0%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.96; 95% CI, 0.59 to 6.49). CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk ambulatory patients with cancer, treatment with rivaroxaban did not result in a significantly lower incidence of venous thromboembolism or death due to venous thromboembolism in the 180-day trial period.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Hypoxemia is the most common complication during tracheal intubation of critically ill adults and may increase the risk of cardiac arrest and death. Whether positive-pressure ventilation with a bag-mask device (bag-mask ventilation) during tracheal intubation of critically ill adults prevents hypoxemia without increasing the risk of aspiration remains controversial. METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized trial conducted in seven intensive care units in the United States, we randomly assigned adults undergoing tracheal intubation to receive either ventilation with a bag-mask device or no ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy. The primary outcome was the lowest oxygen saturation observed during the interval between induction and 2 minutes after tracheal intubation. The secondary outcome was the incidence of severe hypoxemia, defined as an oxygen saturation of less than 80%. RESULTS: Among the 401 patients enrolled, the median lowest oxygen saturation was 96% (interquartile range, 87 to 99) in the bag-mask ventilation group and 93% (interquartile range, 81 to 99) in the no-ventilation group (P = 0.01). A total of 21 patients (10.9%) in the bag-mask ventilation group had severe hypoxemia, as compared with 45 patients (22.8%) in the no-ventilation group (relative risk, 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30 to 0.77). Operator-reported aspiration occurred during 2.5% of intubations in the bag-mask ventilation group and during 4.0% in the no-ventilation group (P = 0.41). The incidence of new opacity on chest radiography in the 48 hours after tracheal intubation was 16.4% and 14.8%, respectively (P = 0.73). CONCLUSIONS: Among critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation, patients receiving bag-mask ventilation had higher oxygen saturations and a lower incidence of severe hypoxemia than those receiving no ventilation.

    "AB": "Importance: Postoperative delirium is common following cardiac surgery and may be affected by choice of analgesic and sedative. Objective: To evaluate the effect of postoperative intravenous (IV) acetaminophen (paracetamol) vs placebo combined with IV propofol vs dexmedetomidine on postoperative delirium among older patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, placebo-controlled, factorial clinical trial among 120 patients aged 60 years or older undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery or combined CABG/valve surgeries at a US center. Enrollment was September 2015 to April 2018, with follow-up ending in April 2019. Interventions: Patients were randomized to 1 of 4 groups receiving postoperative analgesia with IV acetaminophen or placebo every 6 hours for 48 hours and postoperative sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol starting at chest closure and continued for up to 6 hours (acetaminophen and dexmedetomidine: n = 29; placebo and dexmedetomidine: n = 30; acetaminophen and propofol: n = 31; placebo and propofol: n = 30). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was incidence of postoperative in-hospital delirium by the Confusion Assessment Method. Secondary outcomes included delirium duration, cognitive decline, breakthrough analgesia within the first 48 hours, and ICU and hospital length of stay. Results: Among 121 patients randomized (median age, 69 years; 19 women [15.8%]), 120 completed the trial. Patients treated with IV acetaminophen had a significant reduction in delirium (10% vs 28% placebo; difference, -18% [95% CI, -32% to -5%]; P = .01; HR, 2.8 [95% CI, 1.1-7.8]). Patients receiving dexmedetomidine vs propofol had no significant difference in delirium (17% vs 21%; difference, -4% [95% CI, -18% to 10%]; P = .54; HR, 0.8 [95% CI, 0.4-1.9]). There were significant differences favoring acetaminophen vs placebo for 3 prespecified secondary outcomes: delirium duration (median, 1 vs 2 days; difference, -1 [95% CI, -2 to 0]), ICU length of stay (median, 29.5 vs 46.7 hours; difference, -16.7 [95% CI, -20.3 to -0.8]), and breakthrough analgesia (median, 322.5 vs 405.3 microg morphine equivalents; difference, -83 [95% CI, -154 to -14]). For dexmedetomidine vs propofol, only breakthrough analgesia was significantly different (median, 328.8 vs 397.5 microg; difference, -69 [95% CI, -155 to -4]; P = .04). Fourteen patients in both the placebo-dexmedetomidine and acetaminophen-propofol groups (46% and 45%) and 7 in the acetaminophen-dexmedetomidine and placebo-propofol groups (24% and 23%) had hypotension. Conclusions and Relevance: Among older patients undergoing cardiac surgery, postoperative scheduled IV acetaminophen, combined with IV propofol or dexmedetomidine, reduced in-hospital delirium vs placebo. Additional research, including comparison of IV vs oral acetaminophen and other potentially opioid-sparing analgesics, on the incidence of postoperative delirium is warranted.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: The ability to generate high levels of power is one of the key factors determining success in many sport disciplines. Although there are studies confirming ergogenic effects of caffeine (CAF) on different physical and mental abilities, much controversy remains about its influence on power. The main goal of this study was to assess the effects of caffeine supplementation on time under tension (TUT) and the number of performed repetitions (REP). The second objective was to determine the effects of CAF supplementation on power (P) and movement velocity (V) during the bench press movement. Additionally the authors evaluated whether CAF has a significant effect on velocity of the bar in the eccentric (ECC) phase (VEMEAN) of the bench press movement. METHODS: The study included 20 men (20-31 yrs., 87.3 +/- 7.7 kg) with at least 2 years of experience in resistance training. The study participants were divided randomly into two groups: the supplemented group ingested caffeine before exercise (GCAF), while the control group was given a placebo (GCON). The exercise protocol consisted of performing the bench press movement with a load equal to 70%1RM with maximal possible velocity (X/0/X/0). The experimental sets were performed to momentary muscular failure. RESULTS: The repeated measures ANOVA between the GCAF and GCON groups revealed statistically significant differences in 2 variables. Post-hoc tests demonstrated statistically significant differences in TUT when comparing the group supplemented with caffeine (13.689 s GCAF) to the one ingesting a placebo (15.332 s GCON) at p = 0.002. Significant differences were also observed in mean velocity during the eccentric phase of movement (0.690 m/s in the GCAF to 0.609 in GCON with p = 0.002). There were no significant differences in generated power and velocity in the CON phase of the movement between the GCAF and GCON. CONCLUSIONS: The main finding of the study is that CAF ingestion increases movement velocity of the bar in the eccentric phase of the movement, what results in shortening of the time under tension (TUT) needed for performing a specific number of repetitions, without decreasing power and velocity in the CON phase of the movement.",

    "AB": "Importance: A meta-analysis of outcomes during the 6 months after intensive care unit (ICU) discharge indicate a prevalence for clinically important posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms of 25%. Objective: To determine whether a nurse-led preventive, complex psychological intervention, initiated in the ICU, reduces patient-reported PTSD symptom severity at 6 months. Design, Setting, and Participants: A multicenter, parallel-group, cluster-randomized clinical trial with integrated economic and process evaluations conducted in 24 ICUs in the United Kingdom. Participants were critically ill patients who regained mental capacity following receipt of level 3 (intensive) care. A total of 2961 eligible patients were identified from September 2015 to January 2017. A total of 2048 were approached for participation in the ICU, of which 1458 provided informed consent. Follow-up was completed December 2017. Interventions: Twenty four ICUs were randomized 1:1 to the intervention or control group. Intervention ICUs (n = 12; 669 participants) delivered usual care during a baseline period followed by an intervention period. The preventive, complex psychological intervention comprised promotion of a therapeutic ICU environment plus 3 stress support sessions and a relaxation and recovery program delivered by trained ICU nurses to high-risk (acutely stressed) patients. Control ICUs (n = 12; 789 participants) delivered usual care in both baseline and intervention periods. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary clinical outcome was PTSD symptom severity among survivors at 6 months measured using the PTSD Symptom Scale-Self-Report questionnaire (score range, 0-51, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity; the minimal clinically important difference was considered to be 4.2 points). Results: Among 1458 enrolled patients (mean [SD] age, 58 [16] years; 599 women [41%]), 1353 (93%) completed the study and were included in the final analysis. At 6 months, the mean PTSD Symptom Scale-Self-Report questionnaire score in intervention ICUs was 11.8 (baseline period) compared with 11.5 (intervention period) (difference, -0.40 [95% CI, -2.46 to 1.67]) and in control ICUs, 10.1 (baseline period) compared with 10.2 (intervention period) (difference, 0.06 [95% CI, -1.74 to 1.85]) between periods. There was no significant difference in PTSD symptom severity at 6 months (treatment effect estimate [difference in differences] of -0.03 [95% CI, -2.58 to 2.52]; P = .98). Conclusions and Relevance: Among critically ill patients in the ICU, a nurse-led preventive, complex psychological intervention did not significantly reduce patient-reported PTSD symptom severity at 6 months. These findings do not support the use of this psychological intervention. Trial Registration: ISRCTN53448131.",

    "AB": "Importance: Abnormal peripheral perfusion after septic shock resuscitation has been associated with organ dysfunction and mortality. The potential role of the clinical assessment of peripheral perfusion as a target during resuscitation in early septic shock has not been established. Objective: To determine if a peripheral perfusion-targeted resuscitation during early septic shock in adults is more effective than a lactate level-targeted resuscitation for reducing mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter, randomized trial conducted at 28 intensive care units in 5 countries. Four-hundred twenty-four patients with septic shock were included between March 2017 and March 2018. The last date of follow-up was June 12, 2018. Interventions: Patients were randomized to a step-by-step resuscitation protocol aimed at either normalizing capillary refill time (n = 212) or normalizing or decreasing lactate levels at rates greater than 20% per 2 hours (n = 212), during an 8-hour intervention period. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 28 days. Secondary outcomes were organ dysfunction at 72 hours after randomization, as assessed by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range, 0 [best] to 24 [worst]); death within 90 days; mechanical ventilation-, renal replacement therapy-, and vasopressor-free days within 28 days; intensive care unit and hospital length of stay. Results: Among 424 patients randomized (mean age, 63 years; 226 [53%] women), 416 (98%) completed the trial. By day 28, 74 patients (34.9%) in the peripheral perfusion group and 92 patients (43.4%) in the lactate group had died (hazard ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.55 to 1.02]; P = .06; risk difference, -8.5% [95% CI, -18.2% to 1.2%]). Peripheral perfusion-targeted resuscitation was associated with less organ dysfunction at 72 hours (mean SOFA score, 5.6 [SD, 4.3] vs 6.6 [SD, 4.7]; mean difference, -1.00 [95% CI, -1.97 to -0.02]; P = .045). There were no significant differences in the other 6 secondary outcomes. No protocol-related serious adverse reactions were confirmed. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with septic shock, a resuscitation strategy targeting normalization of capillary refill time, compared with a strategy targeting serum lactate levels, did not reduce all-cause 28-day mortality.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze the response of selected components of the immune system in rowers to maximal physical exercise, and to verify if this response could be modulated by supplementation with L-theanine. METHOD: The double-blind study included 20 members of the Polish Rowing Team. The subjects were randomly assigned to the supplemented group (n = 10), receiving 150 mg of L-theanine extract for 6 weeks, or to the placebo group (n = 10). The participants performed a 2000-m test on a rowing ergometer at the beginning (1st examination) and at the end of the supplementation period (2nd examination). Blood samples were obtained from the antecubital vein before each exercise test, 1 min after completing the test, and after a 24-h recovery. Subpopulations of T regulatory lymphocytes (Tregs) (CD4+/CD25+/CD127-), cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) (CD8+/TCRalphabeta+), natural killer (NK) cells (CD3-/CD16+/CD56+) and TCRdeltagamma-positive (Tdeltagamma) cells were determined by means of flow cytometry. The levels of interleukin 2 (IL-2), interleukin 4 (IL-4), interleukin 10 (IL-10), interferon gamma (INF-) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were determined with commercially available diagnostic kits. RESULTS: Supplementation with L-theanine contributed to a significant post-exercise decrease in IL-10 concentration, which was reflected by higher values of IL-2 to IL-10 and IFN-gamma to IL-10 ratios. Moreover, a significant post-recovery decrease in CTL count, Treg to NK and Treg to CTL ratios was observed in the supplemented group. CONCLUSION: Despite the decrease in the number of some cytotoxic cells (CTLs) and an increase in the proportion of Tregs to CTLs, supplementation with LTE seems to exert a beneficial effect on a disrupted Th1/Th2 balance in elite athletes, as shown by the decrease in IL-10 concentration.",

    "AB": "Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common orthopedic surgery known to be very painful. Emphasis has been placed on TKA pain management for postoperative care and during rehabilitation. Music therapy is used as a nonpharmacologic intervention for pain management and to promote rehabilitation exercise adherence. The objective of this study was to explore the effects of music therapy/physical therapy co-treatment using live music-supported exercise on pain and exercise adherence during a lower extremity pedaling exercise to facilitate range of motion (ROM). The researcher randomized 32 TKA inpatient rehabilitation participants to an intervention or control group. Following baseline measures, two study intervals occurred with the intervention group receiving live music for the first interval followed by no music during the second interval; the control group received no music during both intervals. Self-reported pain measures, observed pain measures, and observed measures of pedaling adherence were collected for each participant. A mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures showed no significant effects for self-reported pain perception. For observed pain, ANOVA results did show a significant interaction (p < .05) between group and study interval. There were no statistically significant effects for pedaling adherence. Conclusions show an important role for live music therapy intervention on observed pain while engaged in co-treatment during this lower extremity ROM exercise. Additional implications and limitations are discussed.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Hospitalized patients who are colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are at high risk for infection after discharge. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of postdischarge hygiene education, as compared with education plus decolonization, in patients colonized with MRSA (carriers). Decolonization involved chlorhexidine mouthwash, baths or showers with chlorhexidine, and nasal mupirocin for 5 days twice per month for 6 months. Participants were followed for 1 year. The primary outcome was MRSA infection as defined according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. Secondary outcomes included MRSA infection determined on the basis of clinical judgment, infection from any cause, and infection-related hospitalization. All analyses were performed with the use of proportional-hazards models in the per-protocol population (all participants who underwent randomization, met the inclusion criteria, and survived beyond the recruitment hospitalization) and as-treated population (participants stratified according to adherence). RESULTS: In the per-protocol population, MRSA infection occurred in 98 of 1063 participants (9.2%) in the education group and in 67 of 1058 (6.3%) in the decolonization group; 84.8% of the MRSA infections led to hospitalization. Infection from any cause occurred in 23.7% of the participants in the education group and 19.6% of those in the decolonization group; 85.8% of the infections led to hospitalization. The hazard of MRSA infection was significantly lower in the decolonization group than in the education group (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 0.96; P=0.03; number needed to treat to prevent one infection, 30; 95% CI, 18 to 230); this lower hazard led to a lower risk of hospitalization due to MRSA infection (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.99). The decolonization group had lower likelihoods of clinically judged infection from any cause (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.99) and infection-related hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.93); treatment effects for secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution owing to a lack of prespecified adjustment for multiple comparisons. In as-treated analyses, participants in the decolonization group who adhered fully to the regimen had 44% fewer MRSA infections than the education group (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.86) and had 40% fewer infections from any cause (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.78). Side effects (all mild) occurred in 4.2% of the participants. CONCLUSIONS: Postdischarge MRSA decolonization with chlorhexidine and mupirocin led to a 30% lower risk of MRSA infection than education alone.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a surgical procedure to replace the weight-bearing surfaces of the knee joint to relieve pain and disability. However, blood loss and fibrinolytic activity, accounting for a poor prognosis following TKA operation, were relieved by fibrinolytic inhibitor tranexamic acid (TXA). For a better application of TXA function, we explored the effect of intravenous injection (IV) of TXA combined with intra-articular injection (IA) of TXA in patients after TKA. METHODS: Patients admitted from Weifang People's Hospital from January 2015 to December 2016 who received TKA were injected with 20 mg/kg TXA by IV before TKA (n = 50), 3.0 g TXA by IA after TKA (n = 50), or combination of 20 mg/kg TXA by IV before TKA and 3.0 g TXA by IA after TKA (n = 50). Knee function was assessed using HSS, KSS, NASS, and ROM. In addition, the total blood loss (TBL), hidden blood loss (HBL), maximum hemoglobin (Hb) drop, fibrinolytic activity, as well as incidence of thromboembolism were measured. The patients were followed up for 6 months. The deadline for follow-up was June 2017 and the incidence of thromboembolism events within 6 months after operation was counted. RESULTS: HSS, KSS, NASS scores, and ROM were elevated after patients receiving TKA. Patients received IV plus IA TXA has decreased TBL, HBL, and maximum Hb drop than those received IV TXA-alone and IA TXA-alone, with reductions in FDP and D-dimer, indicating that IV plus IA TXA injection is superior to prevent blood loss and hyperfibrinolysis during TKA. Age, sex, type of femoral prosthesis, and the injection method of TXA were risk factors for HBL of patients after receiving TKA. CONCLUSIONS: The aforementioned results demonstrate that TKA is an effective surgery, and IV plus IA TXA injection functions more effectively in reducing blood loss and fibrinolytic activity in patients, which is a clinical factor of occult hemorrhage.",

    "AB": "Asthma and body posture abnormalities in children and young people are major epidemiological problems worldwide. Asthma among children and adolescents, its relations with physical activity (PA) and PA relations with body posture were and are still being investigated.The aim of this study was to investigate how body posture is shaped in children diagnosed with asthma symptoms and whether body posture is associated with PA. The study involved 192 children. The main group consisted of 90 children diagnosed with asthma and allergies symptoms age 9 to 12 years old (x = 10.75 +/- 1.08). The control group included 102 healthy children at the similar age (x = 10.64 +/- 1.1). The level of activity has been assessed on the basis of a questionnaire and body posture assessments were done using a plumb line, pediscoliometer, digital inclinometer.Comparison of percentage of respondents fitting into body posture norms clearly indicates higher value in the group classified as active. In the group of participants diagnosed with asthma, percentage differences of participants with good body posture (without postural defects) were statistically significant. Among healthy children, percentages of the participants were higher in active children than in inactive children.Body posture is directly related to PA and the lack of activity affects disturbances within posturometric parameters. Prevention of body posture abnormalities is worth promoting in groups of children, also with various diseases including asthma and allergies symptoms.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Upper extremity functional impairments are common consequences of stroke. Therefore, continuous investigation of effective interventions for upper extremity functions after stroke is a necessity. Segmental muscle vibration (SMV) is one of the interventions that incorporate sensory stimulation to improve motor cortical excitability. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of 5-minute SMV application along with supervised physical therapy (SPT) on improving activities of daily living and motor recovery on the hemiparetic upper extremity in patients with stroke. METHODS: A sample of 37 patients poststroke (29 males) was randomly allocated to either SPT control group (n = 18) or SPT and SMV (SPT-SMV) experimental group (n = 19). All patients received 3 sessions per week of SPT for 8 weeks. The SPT-SMV experimental group received SMV at the end of each SPT session. Outcome measures used were Barthel index (BI), modified Ashworth scale, manual muscle testing, and goniometry for range of motion (ROM) assessment. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients completed the study. Patients in both groups improved significantly after treatment in BI, elbow ROM, and elbow muscles strength. However, muscle tone in elbow joint of the hemiplegic upper extremity improved significantly after SMV only in the experimental group (SPT-SMV). CONCLUSION: The SPT intervention can improve functional outcomes of upper extremity in people after stroke. However, using SMV may have superior effect on improving muscle tone after stroke.",

    "AB": "Surgical site infection (SSI) and incisional hernia are common complications after major pancreatectomy. We investigated the effects of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) on short- and long-term wound outcomes in patients undergoing pancreatectomy. A randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of NPWT with standard surgical dressing (SSD) on wounds was performed in 265 patients undergoing open gastrointestinal resections from 2012 to 2016. We performed a subset analysis of 73 patients who underwent pancreatectomy. Wound complications in the first 30 days and incisional hernia rates were assessed. There were 33 (45%) female patients in the study and the average BMI was 27.6. The pancreaticoduodectomy rate was 68 per cent, whereas 27 per cent of patients underwent distal or subtotal pancreatectomy, and 4 per cent total pancreatectomy. Incisional hernia rates were 32 per cent and 14 per cent between the SSD and NPWT groups, respectively (P = 0.067). In the SSD (n = 37) and NPWT (n = 36) cohorts, the superficial SSI, deep SSI, seroma, and dehiscence rates were 16 per cent and 14 per cent (P > 0.99), 5 per cent and 8 per cent (P = 0.67), 16 per cent and 11 per cent (P = 0.74), and 5 per cent and 3 per cent (P >/= 0.99), respectively. After adjusting for pancreatic fistula and delayed gastric emptying, no statistically significant differences in the primary outcomes were observed. These findings were true irrespective of the type of resection performed. Short- and long-term wound complications were not improved with NPWT. We observed a trend toward decreased incisional hernia rates in patients treated with NPWT. Owing to the multifactorial nature of wound complications, it is yet to be determined which cohorts of pancreatectomy patients will benefit from NPWT.",

    "AB": "Subepithelial connective tissue grafts (SCTGs) with a coronally advanced flap (CAF) are accepted as the gold standard for covering denuded root surfaces. In recent years, enamel matrix derivatives (EMDs) have been used for their regenerative potential in periodontics. The aim of this split-mouth and randomized controlled study was to assess the clinical and aesthetical impacts of EMD application in combination with SCTG+CAF in patients with Miller's Class I and II gingival recessions in contralateral canines of the maxilla. Participants who underwent SCTG+CAF+EMD application were identified as the test group (n = 19) and those who underwent SCTG+CAF as control group (n = 19). The outcome parameters were recession depth/width, root coverage percentage, and root coverage aesthetic score (RES). RES was evaluated by two calibrated blind periodontists one year after the treatment. Statistically significant root coverage percentage was observed at one year post-treatment for both groups (p < 0.05). However, significant differences between the groups were not observed in terms of total RES and complete root coverage rate (p > 0.05). The test group had significantly better results than the control according to the soft tissue texture and mucogingival junction alignment results (p < 0.05). These results indicate that EMDs contribute to the healing of soft tissue without scarring. As a result of better wound healing, the EMD-added group exhibited better results in terms of the harmony of the mucogingival junction between adjacent teeth. This paper is the first split-mouth study in which SCTG+CAF and SCTG+CAF+EMD were compared using RES in bilateral canines.",

Pulpectomy was performed on 27 primary teeth with necrosis or irreversible pulpitis, caused by dental caries or trauma, in 23 children (2-7 years old). A single trained operator performed the CT in a single visit in cases without periapical or interradicular radiolucency (PIR) or in multiple visits in cases with PIR. Participants were selected based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, and randomly allocated into two groups: Group 1 (G1) - iodoform paste (iodoform + camphorated parachlorophenol + ointment comprising prednisolone acetate 5.0 mg and rifamycin 1.5 mg); Group 2 (G2) - Calen(R)/ZO paste. Treated teeth were restored with composite resin immediately after the root canal filling. The outcomes were evaluated clinically and radiographically according to specific criteria. Two blinded and standardized evaluators assessed the radiographic outcomes. We used descriptive analyses due to the small sample size. CTs were performed due to caries lesions in 70.4% of the cases and due to trauma in 29.6%. Only one tooth of G1 was unsuccessful; hence, pulpectomy performance in both groups was not influenced by the filling material, nor by any other analyzed variable. The level of the root canal filling was better in the Calen(R)/ZO group. The clinical and radiographic twelve-month outcomes indicated successful treatment, independently of the root filling material used.",

    "AB": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to translate laboratory-based research on beverage-based supplements to a naturalistic, field setting in adolescent athletes. To this end, we tested the effects of two commercially-available drinks on strength in a field-based setting with both male and female high school athletes completing a summer training program. METHODS: One hundred and three high school athletes completed the study (M age = 15.3, SD = 1.2; 70.9% male; 37.9% Afr. Amer.). Measures included a composite strength score (bench press + squat). Participants completed 1 week of pre- and post-testing, and 4 days per week of strength and conditioning training for 5 weeks. Participants were randomly-assigned to receive either CM or CHO immediately post-exercise. RESULTS: A 2 (group) x 2 (time) repeated measures ANOVA showed there was a significant main effect on time for increase in the composite strength score (p = .002, engp2 = .18). There was a significant interaction of composite strength score between groups, (p = .04, engp2 = .08). The CM group (12.3% increase) had significantly greater improvements in composite strength from pre- to post-test than CHO (2.7% increase). There were no differences in these results based on demographic variables. CONCLUSION: This is the first study comparing the impact of CM and CHO on athletic outcomes in an adolescent population in a field-based environment. CM had a more positive effect on strength development and should be considered an appropriate post-exercise recovery supplement for adolescents. Future research will benefit from longer study durations with larger numbers of participants.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Overweight and metabolic problems now add to the burden of illness in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. We aimed to determine if a program of aerobic and resistance exercise could safely achieve body composition changes in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. METHODS: A randomized, cross-over trial of eight weeks combined aerobic and resistance training on body composition assessed by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry was performed. Patients in clinical remission and physically inactive with a mean age of 25 +/- 6.5 years and Body Mass Index of 28.9 +/- 3.8 were recruited from a dedicated Inflammatory Bowel Disease clinic. Serum cytokines were quantified, and microbiota assessed using metagenomic sequencing. RESULTS: Improved physical fitness was demonstrated in the exercise group by increases in median estimated VO2max (Baseline: 43.41mls/kg/min; post-intervention: 46.01mls/kg/min; p = 0.03). Improvement in body composition was achieved by the intervention group (n = 13) with a median decrease of 2.1% body fat compared with a non-exercising group (n = 7) (0.1% increase; p = 0.022). Lean tissue mass increased by a median of 1.59 kg and fat mass decreased by a median of 1.52 kg in the exercising group. No patients experienced a deterioration in disease activity scores during the exercise intervention. No clinically significant alterations in the alpha- and beta-diversity of gut microbiota and associated metabolic pathways were evident. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-intensity combined aerobic and resistance training is safe in physically unfit patients with quiescent Inflammatory Bowel Disease and can quickly achieve favourable body compositional changes without adverse effects. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov; Trial number: NCT02463916 .",

    "AB": "Importance: Multimodal postoperative analgesia is widely used but lacks evidence of benefit. Objective: Investigate beneficial and harmful effects of 4 nonopioid analgesics regimens. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, 4-group trial in 6 Danish hospitals with 90-day follow-up that included 556 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) from December 2015 to October 2017. Final date of follow-up was January 1, 2018. Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive paracetamol (acetaminophen) 1000 mg plus ibuprofen 400 mg (n = 136; PCM + IBU), paracetamol 1000 mg plus matched placebo (n = 142; PCM), ibuprofen 400 mg plus matched placebo (n = 141; IBU), or half-strength paracetamol 500 mg plus ibuprofen 200 mg (n = 140; HS-PCM + IBU) orally every 6 hours for 24 hours postoperatively, starting 1 hour before surgery. Main Outcomes and Measures: Two co-primary outcomes: 24-hour morphine consumption using patient-controlled analgesia in pairwise comparisons between the 4 groups (multiplicity-adjusted thresholds for statistical significance, P < .0042; minimal clinically important difference, 10 mg), and proportion of patients with 1 or more serious adverse events (SAEs) within 90 days (multiplicity-adjusted thresholds for statistical significance, P < .025). Results: Among 559 randomized participants (mean age, 67 years; 277 [50%] women), 556 (99.5%) completed the trial and were included in the analysis. Median 24-hour morphine consumption was 20 mg (99.6% CI, 0-148) in the PCM + IBU group, 36 mg (99.6% CI, 0-166) for PCM alone, 26 mg (99.6% CI, 2-139) for IBU alone, and 28 mg (99.6% CI, 2-145) for HS-PCM + IBU. The median difference in morphine consumption between the PCM + IBU group vs PCM alone was 16 mg (99.6% CI, 6.5 to 24; P < .001); for the PCM-alone group vs HS-PCM + IBU, 8 mg (99.6% CI, -1 to 14; P = .001); and for the PCM + IBU group vs IBU alone, 6 mg (99.6% CI, -2 to 16; P = .002). The difference in morphine consumption was not statistically significant for the PCM + IBU group vs HS-PCM + IBU (8 mg [99.6% CI, -2 to 16]; P = .005) or for the PCM-alone group vs IBU alone (10 mg [99.6% CI, -2 to 16]; P = .004) after adjustment for multiple comparisons and 2 co-primary outcomes. There was no significant difference between the IBU-alone group vs HS-PCM + IBU (2 mg [99.6% CI, -10 to 7]; P = .81). The proportion of patients with SAEs in groups receiving IBU was 15%, and in the PCM-alone group, was 11%. The relative risk of SAE was 1.44 (97.5% CI, 0.79 to 2.64; P = .18). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients undergoing THA, paracetamol plus ibuprofen significantly reduced morphine consumption compared with paracetamol alone in the first 24 hours after surgery; there was no statistically significant increase in SAEs in the pooled groups receiving ibuprofen alone vs with paracetamol alone. However, the combination did not result in a clinically important improvement over ibuprofen alone, suggesting that ibuprofen alone may be a reasonable option for early postoperative oral analgesia.

    "AB": "Dehydration impairs physiological function and physical performance, thus understanding effective rehydration strategies is paramount. Despite growing interest in natural rehydrating beverages, no study has examined maple water (MW). PURPOSE: To investigate the rehydrating efficacy of MW after exercise-induced dehydration. METHODS: Using a single-blind, counterbalanced, crossover design, we compared the rehydrating efficacy of MW vs. maple-flavored bottled water (control) in 26 young healthy (22 +/- 4 yrs., 24 +/- 4 kg/m(2)) males (n = 13) and females (n = 13) after exercise-induced dehydration (~ 2.0%DeltaBody Weight [BW]) in the heat (30 degrees C, 50% relative humidity [RH]). Hydration indicators (BW, salivary and urine osmolality [SOsm/UOsm], urine specific gravity [USG], urine volume [UV], urine color [UC]), thirst, fatigue, and recovery (heart rate [HR)], and HR variability [HRV]) were taken at baseline, post-exercise, 0.5, 1, and 2 h post-consumption of 1 L of MW or control. RESULTS: Following similar dehydration (~ 2%DeltaBW), MW had no differential (p > 0.05) impact on any measure of rehydration. Likely due to greater beverage osmolality (81 +/- 1.4 vs. 11 +/- 0.7 mOsmol/kg), thirst sensation remained 12% higher with MW (p < 0.05). When sex was considered, females had lower UV, elevated UOsm (p < 0.05), trends for higher DeltaBW, USG, but similar SOsm. Analysis of beverages and urine for antioxidant potential (AP) revealed a four-fold greater AP in MW, which increased peak urine AP (9.4 +/- 0.7 vs. 7.6 +/- 1.0 mmol, MW vs. control, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Electrolyte-containing MW, was similar in effectiveness to water, but has antioxidant properties. Furthermore, trends for sex differences were discovered in urinary, but not salivary, hydration markers, with discrepancies in kinetics between fluid compartments both warranting further study.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: We assessed the effect of equivalent weight loss with or without exercise on (intra-) abdominal fat in postmenopausal women in the SHAPE-2 study. METHODS: The SHAPE-2 study is a three-armed randomised controlled trial conducted in 2012-2013 in the Netherlands. Postmenopausal overweight women were randomized to a diet (n = 97), exercise plus diet (n = 98) or control group (n = 48). Both intervention groups aimed for equivalent weight loss (6-7%) following a calorie-restricted diet (diet group) or a partly supervised intensive exercise programme (4 h per week) combined with a small caloric restriction (exercise plus diet group). Outcomes after 16 weeks are amount and distribution of abdominal fat, measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of the three-point IDEAL Dixon method. RESULTS: The diet and exercise plus diet group lost 6.1 and 6.9% body weight, respectively. Compared to controls, subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat reduced significantly with both diet (- 12.5% and - 12.0%) and exercise plus diet (- 16.0% and - 14.6%). Direct comparison between both interventions revealed that the reduction in subcutaneous fat was statistically significantly larger in the group that combined exercise with diet: an additional 10.6 cm(2) (95%CI -18.7; - 2.4) was lost compared to the diet-only group. Intra-abdominal fat loss was not significantly larger in the exercise plus diet group (- 3.8 cm(2), 95%CI -9.0; 1.3). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that weight loss of 6-7% with diet or with exercise plus diet reduced both subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat. Only subcutaneous fat statistically significantly reduced to a larger extent when exercise is combined with a small caloric restriction.

    "AB": "Introduction: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas that spans a wide range ranging from mild to critical forms. Contrary to the progress in the management of severe AP, the MAP has not presented significant changes in recent years. There are also no studies that establish a clear relationship between EEN in MAP and levels of albuminemia and CRP. Material and methods: A randomized, longitudinal and prospective clinical study was conducted. Patients were divided into 2 groups. The experimental group (G1) was indicated from the entrance a diet hyperproteic low in colecistokinetics diet, and to the control group (G2) nothing by mouth. Results: 19 patients were randomly distributed in 57.89% in the G2 and 42.11% in the G1. The G1 presented a higher average hospital stay in relation to the G2, such differences were not significant (p> 0.05). The G1 presented higher values of CRP in relation to the G2 significantly (p ?0.05). There was a decrease in albumin levels in both groups (p ?0.05). It was observed in both groups that, as CRP levels increased, albumin levels decreased significantly (p <0.01). Conclusions: Albuminemia levels decreased significantly in both groups, and this decrease was more marked in the EEN group. The decrease in albuminemia had a direct correlation with CRP levels, which were higher in the G1.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Kinesio tape (KT) on lower limb muscle activation pattern in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) during walking. DESIGN: A parallel-group randomized controlled trial. SETTING: University laboratory setting. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five children with DCD were randomly allocated to the KT group (mean age = 7.97 years) and 24 to the control group (mean age = 8.04 years). INTERVENTION: KT group received KT application to the quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles whereas the control group received no intervention. MEASUREMENTS: Peak muscle activation (in percentage of maximal voluntary isometric contraction [%MVIC]) in the lower limbs during gait was measured by means of surface electromyography, electrogoniometry, and foot contact switches. RESULTS: Gastrocnemius medialis activation during mid stance (23.46%MVIC, 95% CI = -32.53, -14.39) and late stance phases (3.25%MVIC, 95% CI = -5.67, -0.81) of gait increased after the application of KT in the KT group compared to baseline values. The KT group demonstrated 26.87%MVIC (95% CI = 26.87, 7.11) higher gastrocnemius medialis muscle peak activation during mid stance phase at post-test when compared with the control group. Moreover, gastrocnemius medialis and biceps femoris muscle peak activation during loading response decreased by 8.36%MVIC (95% CI = 2.71, 14.02) and 3.54%MVIC (95% CI = 1.08, 6.01), respectively, in the control group overtime. CONCLUSIONS: The application of KT on children with DCD had an increased gastrocnemius medialis muscle activation during stance phase. KT could be incorporated into gait re-education programmes to facilitate muscle contraction in these children.",

In FZD group, 92 patients were treated with FZD plus esomeprazole, bismuth potassium citrate, and amoxicillin for 14 days. In CLA group, 93 patients were treated with the same regimen except FZD was replaced by CLA. Patients were tested 4 weeks post-treatment to confirm eradication.Of the 185 enrolled patients, 180 completed the study. On intention-to-treat analysis, Hp eradication rates in FZD and CLA groups were 90.22% and 86.02% (P = .378); in per-protocol analysis, their eradication rates were 93.26% and 87.91%, respectively (P = .220). Overall incidence of total side effects in FZD and CLA groups was 19.57% and 13.98%, and their severe side effects were 3.26% and 2.15%, respectively (P > .05). Cost-effectiveness ratios of FZD and CLA groups were 0.75 and 1.02, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of FZD group over CLA group was -3.62. Eradication failures were not associated with factors including gender, age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption, educational level, and urban-rural distribution in this observation (P > .05).Despite increasing drug resistance to CLA, Hp eradication rates in FZD and CLA groups have no significant difference at present; as FZD-based quadruple therapy is more cost-effective, we recommend this regimen be a first-line choice for Hp eradication.",

    "AB": "Several approved inactivated hepatitis A (HA) vaccines are available in Korea. These have been shown to be immunogenic and safe in European children; however, their immunogenicity and safety have not been investigated among Korean children. We aimed to compare the immunogenicity and safety of the most commonly used HA vaccines in ethnic Korean children aged 12 to 18 months.In this open-label, randomized, prospective, multicenter study, 108 children were enrolled and randomized to receive a pediatric form of Avaxim, Epaxal, or Havrix. The 2nd dose was administered after an interval of 6 months. Anti-HA virus (HAV) immunoglobulin (Ig) G was measured to assess geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and seropositvity rates (>/=20 mIU/mL anti-HAV IgG). To assess safety, local solicited adverse events (AEs), systemic solicited AEs, unsolicited AEs, and serious AEs (SAEs) were graded.Among the 108 participants enrolled, 37, 34, and 37 received Avaxim, Epaxal, and Havrix, respectively. After administration of 2 doses, the seropositivity rates in the Avaxim, Epaxal, and Havrix groups were all 100% (95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 99.0-100, 98.9-100, and 99.0-100, respectively; P < .001). The anti-HAV GMCs in the Avaxim, Epaxal, and Havrix groups were 5868.4 (95% CI: 4237.2-8126.6), 1962.1 (95% CI: 1298.0-2965.9), and 2232.9 mIU/mL (95% CI: 1428.4-3490.4), respectively, after administration of 2 doses (P < .001). There were no significant differences in the proportions of participants reporting local solicited AEs, systemic solicited AEs, unsolicited AEs, and SAEs among the 3 vaccine groups after the 1st and 2nd doses. All local solicited and unsolicited AEs were grade 1 or 2. Grade 3 systemic solicited AE occurred in 5.4% and 2.9% of the participants in the Havrix group after the 1st and 2nd doses, respectively. SAEs after the 1st and 2nd doses were reported in 2 participants and 1 participant, respectively, but none was assessed as being related to vaccination.The results indicate that these vaccines were safe and immunogenic in ethnic Korean children. The results have contributed to the establishing of an HA vaccination policy in Korea and will be informative to countries that plan to initiate vaccination programs against HAV.",

    "AB": "INTRODUCTION: N95 or higher filtering respirators have been recommended in healthcare settings, although there is still a risk of infection due to the improper selection and wearing of respirators. We aimed to assess the effects of training with N95 or higher filter respirators on the protection performance of respirators among healthcare providers in the emergency medical center (EMC). METHODS: This randomized crossover study evaluated 23 healthcare providers. Quantitative fit tests (QNFTs) were performed before and after training using three types of N95 or higher filter respirators (cup-type, fold-type, valve-type). Training was performed by lecture, real-time feedback, and fit check. The primary outcome was the fit factor, and the secondary outcomes were overall fit factor, adequate protection rate, and respiratory preference. RESULTS: Fit factors, overall fit factor, and adequate protection rate were higher after training than before training for the 3 types of respirators (all P < .05). For normal breathing, fit factors before and after training were 121 (10-185) vs 192 (161-200) for cup-type, 200 (39-200) vs 200 (200-200) for fold-type, and 85 (18-157) vs 173 (117-200) for valve-type. For normal breathing, the adequate protection rates before and after training were 62 (0-100) vs 100 (90-100) for cup-type, 100 (0-100) vs 100 (100-100) for fold-type, and 19 (0-100) vs 100 (44-100) for valve-type (all P < .05). The most preferred respirator type was the valve-type (10 persons, 45.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Training on wearing an N95 or higher respirator improved the protection performance of respirators among healthcare providers working in the EMC. The selection of proper respirators and training would be beneficial to the safety of healthcare providers.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (CNLDO) is common and. lacrimal duct probing is the major treatment. But persistent CNLDO in older children makes the success rate rapidly decreased due to long-term chronic inflammation. To improve the success rate, probing combined with tobramycin/dexamethasone ointment is considered effective. But in practice, we found a lot of problems in using the ointment. So we tried tobramycin/dexamethasone eye drops as a replacement. The results is surprising, so we hope to do some further research in order to prove it is worth to clinical application. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of lacrimal duct probing combined with tobramycin/dexamethasone eye drops or ointment on persistent CNLDO in children older than 1-year-old. METHODS: This randomized controlled study included 409 subjects (496 eyes) older than 1-year-old with persistent CNLDO in southwest China, and classified into 3 groups: 96 cases (123 eyes) were the tobramycin/dexamethasone eye drops group (drops group), 88 cases (104 eyes) were the tobramycin/dexamethasone ointment group (ointment group), and 225 cases (269 eyes) were control group which probing with normal saline (NS group). The data of age, sex, and laterality were analyzed through pairwise comparison. Then the 3 groups were divided into 2 subgroups by age, 12 to 24 months and 25 to 36 months. The surgical findings and success rate in two subgroups were compared. RESULTS: The success rates in the tobramycin/dexamethasone eye drops group in both 2 age subgroups were significantly higher than that in the ointment group and NS group (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Probing combined with tobramycin/dexamethasone eye drops was effective and easy-to-perform in the clinic, and it may be a better choice for persistent CNLDO.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Shilajit is a safe, fluvic mineral complex exudate that is common to Ayurvedic medicine and is composed of fulvic acids, dibenzo-alpha-pyrones, proteins, and minerals. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of 8 weeks of Shilajit supplementation at 250 mg.d(- 1) (low dose) and 500 mg.d(- 1) (high dose) versus placebo on maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) strength, concentric peak torque, fatigue-induced percent decline in strength, and serum hydroxyproline (HYP). METHODS: Sixty-three recreationally-active men ([Formula: see text] +/- SD: 21.2 +/- 2.4 yr.; 179.8 +/- 6.3 cm; 83.1 +/- 12.7 kg) volunteered to participate in this study. The subjects were randomly assigned to the high dose, low dose, or placebo group (each group: n = 21). During pre-supplementation testing, the subjects performed 2 pretest MVICs, 2 sets of 50 maximal, bilateral, concentric isokinetic leg extensions at 180 degrees .s(- 1) separated by 2-min of rest, and 2 posttest MVICs. Following 8 weeks of supplementation, the subjects repeated the pre-supplementation testing procedures. In addition, the groups were dichotomized at the 50th percentile based on pre-supplementation MVIC and baseline HYP. Mixed model ANOVAs and ANCOVAs were used to statistically analyze the dependent variables for the total groups (n = 21 per group) as well as dichotomized groups. RESULTS: For the upper 50th percentile group, the post-supplementation adjusted mean percent decline in MVIC was significantly less for the high dose group (8.9 +/- 2.3%) than the low dose (17.0 +/- 2.4%; p = 0.022) and placebo (16.0 +/- 2.4%; p = 0.044) groups. There was no significant (p = 0.774) difference, however, between the low dose and placebo groups. In addition, for the upper 50th percentile group, the adjusted mean post-supplementation baseline HYP for the high dose group (1.5 +/- 0.3 mug.mL(- 1)) was significantly less than both the low dose (2.4 +/- 0.3 mug.mL(- 1); p = 0.034) and placebo (2.4 +/- 0.3 mug.mL(- 1), p = 0.024) groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study demonstrated that 8 weeks of PrimaVie(R) Shilajit supplementation at 500 mg.d(- 1) promoted the retention of maximal muscular strength following the fatiguing protocol and decreased baseline HYP. Thus, PrimaVie(R) Shilajit supplementation at 500 mg.d(- 1) elicited favorable muscle and connective tissue adaptations.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUOND: The purpose of this study was to examine resting the metabolic response to the ingestion of a complex containing Citrus Aurantium + Caffeine (CA + C) and if its consumption influences metabolic recovery following a high-intensity anaerobic exercise bout in habitual caffeine users. METHODS: Ten physically active males (25.1 +/- 3.9 years; weight 78.71 +/- 9.53 kg; height 177.2 +/- 4.6 cm; body fat 15.5 +/- 3.13%) participated in this study. This study was performed in a double-blind, randomized crossover fashion consisting of two exhaustive exercise protocols. On each visit the participants consumed either a CA + C (100 mg of CA and 100 mg of C) or placebo (dextrose) capsule. After consumption, participants were monitored throughout a 45-min ingestion period, then completed a repeated Wingate protocol, and were then monitored throughout a 45-min recovery period. Metabolic function was measured through blood glucose, plasma insulin, plasma triglycerides, and plasma catecholamines: epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE). Biomarkers were taken at four different time points; Ingestion period: baseline (I1), post-ingestion period (I2); Recovery period: immediately post-exercise (R1), post-recovery period (R2). RESULTS: A repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant time-dependent increases in plasma E and NE at I2 only in the CA + C trial (p < 0.05), and a significant decrease in blood glucose at I2 in the PLA trial (p < 0.05); however, no meaningful changes in glucose was observed following CA + C ingestion. No changes in insulin or triglycerides were observed during the ingestion period. No trial-dependent differences were observed in the Recovery period. All biomarkers of metabolic recovery were equivalent when evaluating R1 v R2. Participants recovered in a similar time-dependent manner in all markers of metabolism following the PLA and CA + C trials. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggested that normal recommended dosages of 100 mg CA + 100 mg C is sufficient to promote glucose sparing at rest, with modest increases in SNS activity; however, the individual role of CA or C in this response cannot be determined.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Vaccination has a huge public health impact. Maintaining vaccine coverage is key to avoid the devastating consequences of resurgence. In the Province of Quebec, vaccine coverage in young children are sub-optimal, mostly due to ambivalence toward vaccine safety and efficacy. We previously conducted a regional study in the Quebec's Eastern Townships region, the PromoVac Study, to test a new educational intervention, based on motivational interviewing techniques, aimed at promoting infant vaccination. This first study evidenced that the intervention led to a marked increase in mothers' intention to vaccinate, and vaccine coverage in their infants. The current study protocol aims at scaling up these results at a provincial level using a randomized controlled trial design. METHODS: This pragmatic, randomized, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial will compare the effectiveness of the motivational interviewing to an educational intervention, including the distribution of an information flyer as standard of care on vaccination coverage in four maternity wards across the Province of Quebec (PromovaQ). Adult mothers of children born in participating maternity wards were recruited between March 2014 and February 2015. Vaccination coverage will be assessed at 3-years of age, thus the trial is expected to be completed in March 2019. Statistical analyses will be conducted under the intention-to-treat principle. Vaccine coverage will be analyzed using Chi-squared distribution testing and logistic regression to identify determinant factors. Secondary outcomes will include vaccine hesitation and intention scores, mother's knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about immunization, and psychosocial determinants of intention to vaccinate. DISCUSSION: In the case results of this Provincial RCT be confirmed, serious consideration should then be given by Ministry of Health authorities to the possible implementation of MI-based strategies across provincial maternity wards. To ensure adequate input and secure implementation, study design and results will be reviewed with relevant stakeholders, including the children's families, and provincial and regional decision-makers. Results will be adapted and shared with all stakeholders. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02666872 (Retrospectively registered as January 28, 2016).",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Given the documented decline in levels of physical activity in early adolescence, promoting physical activity in young people is a priority for health promotion. School physical education (PE) is an important existing network in which participation in physical activity beyond school can be promoted to the captive young people. The objective of current article is to present the protocol for a PE teacher-delivered theory-based trial to promote secondary school students' participation in physical activity out-of-school contexts. The intervention will be guided by the trans-contextual model explaining the processes by which PE teachers' support for autonomous motivation in the classroom promotes students' motivation to engage in out-of-school physical activity. We hypothesize that school students receiving the teacher-delivered intervention to promote autonomous motivation toward physical activity will exhibit greater participation in physical activities outside of school, relative to students receiving a control intervention. METHODS: The trial will adopt a waitlist-control design with cluster-randomization by school. PE teachers assigned to the intervention condition will receive a two-week, 12-h training program comprising basic information on how to promote out-of-school physical activity and theory-based training on strategies to promote students' autonomous motivation toward physical activity. Teachers assigned to the waitlist control condition will receive an alternative training on how to monitor physical functional capacity in children with special needs. PE teachers (n = 29) from eleven schools will apply the intervention program to students (n = 502) in PE classes for one month. Physical activity participation, the primary outcome variable, and psychological mediators from the trans-contextual model will be measured at pre-trial, post-trial, and at one-, three- and six-months post-trial. We will also assess teachers' autonomy-supportive techniques and behaviours by observation. DISCUSSION: The study will make a unique contribution to the literature by testing a theory-based intervention delivered by PE teachers to promote school students' participation in out-of-school physical activity. Information will be useful for educators, community stakeholders and policy makers interested in developing programs to promote students' out-of-school physical activity.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: To study the efficacy of the biodegradable collagen implant Ologen(R) as an adjuvant in phaco-viscocanalostomy in patients with coexisting cataract and primary open angle glaucoma. METHODS: This prospective, interventional, randomized clinical study was done at Alpha Vision Center, Zagazig, Egypt. Patients with coexisting cataract and glaucoma were randomized to receive either phaco-viscocanalostomy (Phacovisco group) (39 eyes) or phaco-viscocanalostomy with Ologen(R) implant (OloPhacovisco group) (40 eyes). Follow-up period was 2 years. Nd:YAG laser goniopuncture was done in cases where the intraocular pressure (IOP) was elevated above 21 mmHg after discontinuation of corticosteroid eye drops at any follow-up visit. RESULTS: No significant operative or postoperative complications (other than failure) were encountered in either group. At 2 years follow-up, the mean IOP level was statistically significantly decreased in the OloPhacovisco group (p = 0.02) and complete success occurred in 23 eyes (59.0%) in the Phacovisco group and in 32 eyes (80.0%) in the OloPhacovisco group. There was a statistically significant higher success rate regarding complete success in patients that received Ologen(R) implant (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Ologen(R) implant improved the success rate of phaco-viscocanalostomy. Larger studies with longer follow-up periods may be required to confirm these findings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was retrospectively registered on 20/12/2018 under the number ( NCT03782051 ).",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Induction of delta aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 ( ALAS1) gene expression and accumulation of neurotoxic intermediates result in neurovisceral attacks and disease manifestations in patients with acute intermittent porphyria, a rare inherited disease of heme biosynthesis. Givosiran is an investigational RNA interference therapeutic agent that inhibits hepatic ALAS1 synthesis. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 trial of givosiran in patients with acute intermittent porphyria. In part A of the trial, patients without recent porphyria attacks (i.e., no attacks in the 6 months before baseline) were randomly assigned to receive a single subcutaneous injection of one of five ascending doses of givosiran (0.035, 0.10, 0.35, 1.0, or 2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo. In part B, patients without recent attacks were randomly assigned to receive once-monthly injections of one of two doses of givosiran (0.35 or 1.0 mg per kilogram) or placebo (total of two injections 28 days apart). In part C, patients who had recurrent attacks were randomly assigned to receive injections of one of two doses of givosiran (2.5 or 5.0 mg per kilogram) or placebo once monthly (total of four injections) or once quarterly (total of two injections) during a 12-week period, starting on day 0. Safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and exploratory efficacy outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients in parts A and B and 17 patients in part C underwent randomization. Common adverse events included nasopharyngitis, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Serious adverse events occurred in 6 patients who received givosiran in parts A through C combined. In part C, all 6 patients who were assigned to receive once-monthly injections of givosiran had sustained reductions in ALAS1 messenger RNA (mRNA), delta aminolevulinic acid, and porphobilinogen levels to near normal. These reductions were associated with a 79% lower mean annualized attack rate than that observed with placebo (exploratory efficacy end point). CONCLUSIONS: Once-monthly injections of givosiran in patients who had recurrent porphyria attacks resulted in mainly low-grade adverse events, reductions in induced ALAS1 mRNA levels, nearly normalized levels of the neurotoxic intermediates delta aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen, and a lower attack rate than that observed with placebo.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Omadacycline, a new once-daily aminomethylcycline antibiotic agent that can be administered intravenously or orally, reaches high concentrations in pulmonary tissues and is active against common pathogens that cause community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. METHODS: In a double-blind trial, we randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) adults with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (Pneumonia Severity Index risk class II, III, or IV) to receive omadacycline (100 mg intravenously every 12 hours for two doses, then 100 mg intravenously every 24 hours), or moxifloxacin (400 mg intravenously every 24 hours). A transition to oral omadacycline (300 mg every 24 hours) or moxifloxacin (400 mg every 24 hours), respectively, was allowed after 3 days; the total treatment duration was 7 to 14 days. The primary end point was early clinical response, defined as survival with improvement in at least two of four symptoms (cough, sputum production, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea) and no worsening of symptoms at 72 to 120 hours, without receipt of rescue antibacterial therapy. A secondary end point was investigator-assessed clinical response at a post-treatment evaluation 5 to 10 days after the last dose, with clinical response defined as resolution or improvement in signs or symptoms to the extent that further antibacterial therapy was unnecessary. A noninferiority margin of 10 percentage points was used. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat population included 386 patients in the omadacycline group and 388 patients in the moxifloxacin group. Omadacycline was noninferior to moxifloxacin for early clinical response (81.1% and 82.7%, respectively; difference, -1.6 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -7.1 to 3.8), and the rates of investigator-assessed clinical response at the post-treatment evaluation were 87.6% and 85.1%, respectively (difference, 2.5 percentage points; 95% CI, -2.4 to 7.4). Adverse events that emerged after treatment initiation were reported in 41.1% of the patients in the omadacycline group and 48.5% of the patients in the moxifloxacin group; the most frequent events were gastrointestinal (10.2% and 18.0%, respectively), and the largest difference was for diarrhea (1.0% and 8.0%). Twelve deaths (8 in the omadacycline group and 4 in the moxifloxacin group) occurred during the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Omadacycline was noninferior to moxifloxacin for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in adults.

For both end points, the noninferiority margin was 10 percentage points. RESULTS: In the modified intention-to-treat population, omadacycline (316 patients) was noninferior to linezolid (311 patients) with respect to early clinical response (rate of response, 84.8% and 85.5%, respectively; difference, -0.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -6.3 to 4.9). Omadacycline also was noninferior to linezolid with respect to investigator-assessed clinical response at the post-treatment evaluation in the modified intention-to-treat population (rate of response, 86.1% and 83.6%, respectively; difference, 2.5 percentage points; 95% CI, -3.2 to 8.2) and in the clinical per-protocol population (96.3% and 93.5%, respectively; difference, 2.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.0 to 6.9). In both groups, the efficacy of the trial drug was similar for methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. Adverse events were reported in 48.3% of the patients in the omadacycline group and in 45.7% of those in the linezolid group; the most frequent adverse events in both groups were gastrointestinal (in 18.0% and 15.8% of the patients in the respective groups). CONCLUSIONS: Omadacycline was noninferior to linezolid for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections and had a similar safety profile.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Shoulder pain syndrome (SPS) is frequent and management in primary care is precarious, with a high rate of referral without adequate treatment, overloading rehabilitation and orthopedic services. AIM: To assess the effectiveness of a self-administered rehabilitation program in adults with shoulder pain syndrome in primary care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized, single-blind clinical trial (evaluators) with an experimental group (self-administered rehabilitation) and a control group (standard physical therapy) was carried out in 271 adult patients aged 18 or older with unilateral shoulder pain lasting more than six weeks and less than three months. The primary outcome was the recovery perceived by the patient. Constant score for function, quality of life using SF-36, simple shoulder test (SST) and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score were also calculated at six, 12 and 24 weeks of follow-up. RESULTS: The self-administered rehabilitation program showed an adjusted effectiveness of 51% at the end of treatment compared to 54% of the standard physical therapy (p > 0.05). No differences in the evolution of the other scores assessed were observed between groups. CONCLUSIONS: A self-administered rehabilitation program for painful shoulder was non-inferior than usual physical therapy.",

    "AB": "Importance: Intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) waveform suppression, often suggesting excessive general anesthesia, has been associated with postoperative delirium. Objective: To assess whether EEG-guided anesthetic administration decreases the incidence of postoperative delirium. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized clinical trial of 1232 adults aged 60 years and older undergoing major surgery and receiving general anesthesia at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St Louis. Recruitment was from January 2015 to May 2018, with follow-up until July 2018. Interventions: Patients were randomized 1:1 (stratified by cardiac vs noncardiac surgery and positive vs negative recent fall history) to receive EEG-guided anesthetic administration (n = 614) or usual anesthetic care (n = 618). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was incident delirium during postoperative days 1 through 5. Intraoperative measures included anesthetic concentration, EEG suppression, and hypotension. Adverse events included undesirable intraoperative movement, intraoperative awareness with recall, postoperative nausea and vomiting, medical complications, and death. Results: Of the 1232 randomized patients (median age, 69 years [range, 60 to 95]; 563 women [45.7%]), 1213 (98.5%) were assessed for the primary outcome. Delirium during postoperative days 1 to 5 occurred in 157 of 604 patients (26.0%) in the guided group and 140 of 609 patients (23.0%) in the usual care group (difference, 3.0% [95% CI, -2.0% to 8.0%]; P = .22). Median end-tidal volatile anesthetic concentration was significantly lower in the guided group than the usual care group (0.69 vs 0.80 minimum alveolar concentration; difference, -0.11 [95% CI, -0.13 to -0.10), and median cumulative time with EEG suppression was significantly less (7 vs 13 minutes; difference, -6.0 [95% CI, -9.9 to -2.1]). There was no significant difference between groups in the median cumulative time with mean arterial pressure below 60 mm Hg (7 vs 7 minutes; difference, 0.0 [95% CI, -1.7 to 1.7]). Undesirable movement occurred in 137 patients (22.3%) in the guided and 95 (15.4%) in the usual care group. No patients reported intraoperative awareness. Postoperative nausea and vomiting was reported in 48 patients (7.8%) in the guided and 55 patients (8.9%) in the usual care group. Serious adverse events were reported in 124 patients (20.2%) in the guided and 130 (21.0%) in the usual care group. Within 30 days of surgery, 4 patients (0.65%) in the guided group and 19 (3.07%) in the usual care group died. Conclusions and Relevance: Among older adults undergoing major surgery, EEG-guided anesthetic administration, compared with usual care, did not decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium. This finding does not support the use of EEG-guided anesthetic administration for this indication. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02241655.",

    "AB": "Importance: Whether using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to guide treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) improves disease activity and slows joint damage progression is unknown. Objective: To determine whether an MRI-guided treat-to-target strategy vs a conventional clinical treat-to-target strategy improves outcomes in patients with RA in clinical remission. Design, Setting, and Participants: Two-year, randomized, multicenter trial conducted at 9 hospitals in Denmark. Two hundred patients with RA in clinical remission (disease activity score in 28 joints-C-reactive protein [DAS28-CRP] <3.2 and no swollen joints) were enrolled between April 2012 and June 2015. The final follow-up visit was April 2017. Interventions: Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to an MRI-guided vs a conventional treat-to-target strategy. In the MRI-guided group, the treatment goal was absence of MRI bone marrow edema combined with clinical remission, defined as DAS28-CRP of 3.2 or less and no swollen joints. In the conventional group, the treatment goal was clinical remission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Co-primary outcomes were proportions of patients achieving DAS28-CRP remission (DAS28-CRP <2.6) and with no radiographic progression (no increase in total van der Heijde-modified Sharp score) at 24 months. Significance testing for the primary outcome was based on 1-sided testing. Secondary outcomes were clinical and MRI measures of disease activity, physical function, and quality of life. Results: Of 200 patients randomized (133 women [67%]; mean [SD] age, 61.6 [10.5] years; median baseline DAS28-CRP, 1.9 [interquartile range, 1.7-2.2]; van der Heijde-modified Sharp score, 18.0 [interquartile range, 7.0-42.5]), 76 patients (76%) in the MRI-guided group and 95 (95%) in the conventional group completed the study. Of these, 64 (85%) vs 83 (88%), respectively, reached the primary clinical end point (risk difference, -4.8% [1-sided 95% CI, -13.6% to + infinity; 1-sided P = .19]) and 49 (66%) vs 58 (62%), respectively, reached the primary radiographic end point (risk difference, 4.7% [1-sided 95% CI, -7.0% to + infinity; 1-sided P = .25). Of 10 key secondary end points, 8 were null and 2 showed statistically significant benefit for the MRI treat-to-target group. Seventeen patients (17%) in the MRI-guided treat-to-target group and 6 patients (6%) in the conventional treat-to-target group experienced serious adverse events. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with RA in clinical remission, an MRI-guided treat-to-target strategy compared with a conventional treat-to-target strategy did not result in improved disease activity remission rates or reduce radiographic progression. These findings do not support the use of an MRI-guided strategy for treating patients with RA. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01656278.",

    "AB": "PURPOSE: To evaluate 3-dimensional epithelial remodeling in patients undergoing myopic laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) versus small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE). METHODS: In a prospective randomized contralateral eye study of LASIK versus SMILE procedures, 21 consecutive patients (42 eyes) were evaluated with corneal epithelial mapping by anterior segment optical coherence tomography for up to 2 years. RESULTS: In the LASIK group, central epithelial thickness increased from 52.38 +/- 2.57 mum to 57.00 +/- 4.23 mum and remained almost stable at this level for up to 24 months. In the SMILE eyes, it increased from 52.52 +/- 3.01 mum to 57.15 +/- 4.57 mum and also remained stable for up to 24 months. Both techniques created the same level of epithelial thickness increase and variation, with a significantly higher mid-peripheral epithelial thickness increase. The differences between the preoperative and postoperative changes were found statistically significant, but not different between the 2 techniques at any given time studied. CONCLUSIONS: Both LASIK and SMILE resulted in significant epithelial thickening. This response seemed to be surprisingly quite similar between the 2 different techniques. This study suggests that epithelial remodeling may correlate with relative curvature changes resulting after both techniques, rather than the obvious difference of subepithelial corneal denervation changes.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: The management of acute esophageal variceal bleeding remains a clinical challenge. Band ligation is the main therapeutic option, but it may be technically difficult to perform in active bleeders. This may necessitate an alternative therapy for this group of patients. This study was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of sclerotherapy versus cyanoacrylate injection for management of actively bleeding esophageal varices in cirrhotic patients. METHODS: This prospective study included 113 cirrhotic patients with actively bleeding esophageal varices. They were randomly treated by endoscopic sclerotherapy or cyanoacrylate injection as banding was not suitable for those patients due to profuse bleeding making unclear endoscopic visual field. Primary outcome was incidence of active bleeding control and secondary outcomes were incidence of six weeks rebleeding, complications, and mortality among the studied patients. RESULTS: Initial bleeding control was significantly higher in cyanoacrylate versus sclerotherapy groups (98.25, 83.93% respectively, P = 0.007). No significant differences between sclerotherapy and cyanoacrylate groups regarding rebleeding (26.79, 19.30% respectively, P = 0.344), complications, hospital stay or mortality rate were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this single-center prospective study, both of these therapies appear to have relatively favorable outcomes, although cyanoacrylate injection may be superior to sclerotherapy for initial control of active bleeding.

    "AB": "The current study combined hedonic liking with non-hypothetical experimental auctions to measure consumer preferences for bitter tasting food and identify individual socio-demographic and psychographic characteristics that influence bitter aversion. Furthermore, the research analyzed whether consumer preferences for bitter food were influenced by sensory and health-related information. Findings reveal that respondents (N = 205) are not averse to bitter taste; while, socio-demographic traits influence bitter acceptance, as higher education level and gender (female) positively affect preferences, together with specific individual characteristics as high compensatory health beliefs. Moreover, results prove that participants positively respond to health-related information, whereas information on bitterness-taste generates lower preferences.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Sperm selection strategies aimed at improving success rates of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) include binding to hyaluronic acid (herein termed hyaluronan). Hyaluronan-selected sperm have reduced levels of DNA damage and aneuploidy. Use of hyaluronan-based sperm selection for ICSI (so-called physiological ICSI [PICSI]) is reported to reduce the proportion of pregnancies that end in miscarriage. However, the effect of PICSI on livebirth rates is uncertain. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of PICSI versus standard ICSI for improving livebirth rates among couples undergoing fertility treatment. METHODS: This parallel, two-group, randomised trial included couples undergoing an ICSI procedure with fresh embryo transfer at 16 assisted conception units in the UK. Eligible women (aged 18-43 years) had a body-mass index of 19-35 kg/m(2) and a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration of 3.0-20.0 mIU/mL or, if no FSH measurement was available, an anti-mullerian hormone concentration of at least 1.5 pmol/L. Eligible men (aged 18-55 years) had not had a vasovasostomy or been treated for cancer in the 24 months before recruitment and were able, after at least 3 days of sexual abstinence, to produce freshly ejaculated sperm for the treatment cycle. Couples were randomly assigned (1:1) with an online system to receive either PICSI or a standard ICSI procedure. The primary outcome was full-term (>/=37 weeks' gestational age) livebirth, which was assessed in all eligible couples who completed follow-up. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN99214271. FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, 2014, and Aug 31, 2016, 2772 couples were randomly assigned to receive PICSI (n=1387) or ICSI (n=1385), of whom 2752 (1381 in the PICSI group and 1371 in the ICSI group) were included in the primary analysis. The term livebirth rate did not differ significantly between PICSI (27.4% [379/1381]) and ICSI (25.2% [346/1371]) groups (odds ratio 1.12, 95% CI 0.95-1.34; p=0.18). There were 56 serious adverse events in total, including 31 in the PICSI group and 25 in the ICSI group; most were congenital abnormalities and none were attributed to treatment. INTERPRETATION: Compared with ICSI, PICSI does not significantly improve term livebirth rates. The wider use of PICSI, therefore, is not recommended at present.

    "AB": "Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), an Alzheimer's disease prodrome, is characterized by cognitive and psychological symptoms, the latter aggravating prognosis. A mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) represents a promising non-pharmacological framework for Alzheimer's disease prevention. The Monitoring + Acceptance Theory (MAT) postulates that MBI improves cognition through monitoring, and psychological well-being, through acceptance. This single-blind preliminary randomized-controlled study investigated the effects of a MBI on anxio-depressive symptoms, quality of life, and memory, compared to a psychoeducation-based intervention in older adults with aMCI. The contribution of MAT components and of ruminations' reduction to intervention efficacy were examined. Participants assigned to both conditions experienced similar benefits regarding anxio-depressive symptoms and aging-related quality of life. General quality of life and memory remained unchanged. A partial support of the MAT and of ruminations reduction to the MBI's efficacy was found. The findings provide new insights on the effects and mechanisms of a MBI on aMCI symptoms.",

    "AB": "Women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) often complain about depression when their menstrual cycle begins. This study investigated the effects of yoga on women with PMS suffering from depression during menstrual cycle. METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted from April to October 2015 in Tabriz, Iran. All subjects (20-45 years old), who were frequently referred to the private obstetrics and gynecology clinics, were initially monitored for PMS and depression. Subjects completed the demographic and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) questionnaires before and after intervention. In addition, subjects were monitored for eligible and ineligible criteria. In this study 62 subjects were randomly selected for the yoga group and control groups. Subjects practiced yoga over two months in three sessions, the duration of each session was 60min. RESULTS: The general score of the depression after yoga intervention was statistically significant compared to the control group (P<0.036) and yoga group before intervention (P<0.001). The diastolic pressure decreased significantly after yoga intervention (P<0.029). Yoga decreased the state of depression and diastolic pressure of the subjects with PMS complaining from depression. CONCLUSION: We conclude that yoga has strong effects on depression symptoms and blood pressure, therefore it can be used as a complementary or alternative remedy for PMS patients.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Self-efficacy is considered as one of the influential parameters affecting the health of patients. This study aimed to investigate the effect of relaxation techniques on self-efficacy of patients suffering from cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a clinical trial in which 80 patients suffering from cancer were randomly assigned to two groups of experimental and control. Data collection instruments consisted of demographic information and Strategies Used by People to Promote Health questionnaires. In the experimental group, the patients performed relaxation techniques once a day for 30min over two months. In the control group, the patients received the routine care. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was observed between the mean self-efficacy indices in the experimental group (p=0.001). There was no significant difference in the control group (p=0.3). CONCLUSION: Muscle relaxation can enhance self-efficacy of cancer patients. Therefore, it can be used as an alternative method for patients who are willing to use this technique.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of Gua Sha therapy in patients with chronic low back pain. METHODS: 50 patients with chronic low back pain (78% female, 49.7+/-10.0 years) were randomized to two Gua Sha treatments (n=25) or waitlist control (n=25). Primary outcome was current pain intensity (100-mm visual analog scale); secondary outcome measures included function (Oswestry Disability Index), pain on movement (Pain on Movement Questionnaire), perceived change in health status, pressure pain threshold, mechanical detection threshold, and vibration detection threshold. RESULTS: After treatment, patients in the Gua Sha group reported lower pain intensity (p<0.001) and better overall health status (p=0.002) compared to the waitlist group. No further group differences were found. No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Gua Sha appears to be an acceptable, safe, and effective treatment for patients with chronic low back pain. Further rigorous studies are needed to confirm and extend these results.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Various studies indicate the negative effects of menopausal symptoms and complications on the quality of life (QOL) of women. The tendency to use different methods of complementary medicine to control menopausal symptoms is increasing. In addition, lavender essential oil has been shown to have positive effects on some symptoms associated with menopause. Thus, the present study was conducted with the aim to determine the effect of lavender aromatherapy on the QOL of postmenopausal women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized, controlled, clinical trial was conducted on 62 postmenopausal women referred to health centers of Isfahan, Iran. The subjects were divided into two groups of control and intervention. The intervention group inhaled 2% lavender essential oil every night before bedtime for 20 minutes during one month. The control group received the placebo (distilled water) in the same manner as the intervention group. The data collection tools were the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL)and a demographic characteristics questionnaire. The results were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical tests in SPSS software. RESULTS: The independent t-test showed a significant difference in the mean total score of QOL and its various dimensions (vasomotor, psychosocial, physical, and sexual dimensions) after the intervention between the aromatherapy and placebo groups (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Inhalation aromatherapy using lavender essential oil can improve the QOL of postmenopausal women with a reduction in the severity of complications and physical-psychological symptoms.",

    "AB": "This study was conducted to evaluate the Effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) on the Illness Perception (IP) and Psychological Symptoms (PS) for Patients in primary care with an active symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The present design is a clinical trial that uses the pre-test and post-test design with a control group. MBCT as an evidence-based psychotherapeutic intervention and Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI), is an 8-week course developed for patients with relapsing depression that integrates mindfulness meditation practices and cognitive therapy. This semi-experimental study was conducted using a pretest-posttest and control group. Diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of patients with RA were all patients with RA who visited the clinic of Jam Rheumatology Centers and met other inclusion criteria in Mashhad in the spring of 2018. Therefore, 28 patients were randomly selected from the diagnostic group. They were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group (14 individuals in each group) and then were post-tested after two months. The data were collected using the revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21 scores) which were completed by the participants. The data were analyzed using repeated measures MANOVA. The results showed that there was a significant difference between the mean scores of pre-test (before MBI) and post-test (after MBI) in the experimental group compared to the control group, and MBCT had a significant effect on the perception of the disease and the psychological syndrome in the experimental group compared to the control group. Therefore, it can be concluded that MBCT is effective on IP and psychological syndrome and can be used as an MBI method to reduce the illness perceptions in people with RA. The future researches with longer pursuing period's efficacy continuation are suggested.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of green tea as an adjunctive therapy to standard antimicrobial treatment in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this blinded randomized trial, 70 patients were assigned to receive four 500mg capsules of green tea or starch as placebo daily for three days along with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The presence of acute uncomplicated cystitis symptoms was recorded and urinalysis was performed. RESULTS: Women in the green tea group showed a statistically significant decrease in the prevalence of cystitis symptoms and a statistically significant improvement in the urinalysis results except for hematuria after 3 days of treatment. CONCLUSION: Green tea was an effective adjunct to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to treat acute uncomplicated cystitis in women.",

    "AB": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this 2-arm parallel study was to compare the dentoalveolar and skeletal changes achieved with Twin-block appliance therapy prescribed on either a part- or full-time basis for 12 months. METHODS: Sixty-two 10- to 14-year-old patients were randomly allocated to either full-time (FT, 22 hours daily) or part-time (PT, 12 hours daily) wear of a modified Twin-block appliance. Participants were recruited from the Institute of Dentistry, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, United Kingdom, and recalled at 6- to 8-week intervals. Electronic randomization was undertaken, with group allocation concealed using opaque, sealed envelopes. The outcome assessor was blinded; however, it was not feasible to blind either operator or patients. Study models and cephalograms were taken at baseline and after 12 months of treatment. RESULTS: Data from 55 of the 62 participants were analyzed. Overjets were reduced by 7 mm (SD, 2.92) in the PT group and 6.5 mm (SD, 2.62) in the FT group, with no statistical difference between the groups (P = 0.587; 95% CI, -1.01, 1.78). Similarly, no clinical or statistical differences were noted for skeletal changes: ANB angle (PT, -1.51 degrees ; FT, -1.25 degrees ; P = 0.828; 95% CI, -0.68, 0.849), pogonion-sella vertical (PT, 3.25 mm; FT, 3.35 mm) or A-sella vertical (PT, 1.28 mm; FT, 1.06 mm). Mean wear durations were 8.78 hours a day in the PT group and 12.38 hours in the FT group. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in either dental or skeletal changes achieved with PT or FT wear of a Twin-block appliance over 12 months. Less onerous PT wear regimens may therefore be a viable alternative to FT wear of removable functional appliances. REGISTRATION: NCT02190630. PROTOCOL: The protocol was not published before trial commencement.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: We previously showed that human anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATLG) plus ciclosporin and methotrexate given to patients with acute leukaemia in remission, having allogeneic haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation with peripheral blood stem cells from an HLA-identical sibling donor after myeloablative conditioning, significantly reduced 2-year chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) incidence and severity, without increasing disease relapse and infections, and improves cGVHD-free and relapse-free survival (cGRFS). The aim of an extended follow-up study was the assessment of long-term outcomes, which are, in this context, scarcely reported in the literature. We report unpublished data on quality of life (QoL) from the original study and the results of a follow-up extension. METHODS: In the original open-label study, patients with acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukaemia in first or subsequent remission, having sibling HLA-identical allogeneic peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ATLG plus standard GVHD prophylaxis with ciclosporin and short-term methotrexate (ATLG group) or standard GVHD prophylaxis without ATLG (non-ATLG group). Conditioning regimens were cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg with either total body irradiation (12 Gy) or busulfan (12.8 mg/kg intravenously or 16 mg/kg orally), with or without etoposide (30-60 mg/kg). Randomisation was stratified according to centre and disease risk. The primary endpoint was cumulative incidence of cGVHD at 2 years. The primary and secondary endpoints, excluding QoL, have been published. QoL, assessed using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-HDC29 questionnaires, was an unpublished secondary endpoint, which we now report here. A follow-up extension was then done, with the primary endpoint cumulative incidence of cGVHD. Enrolment has been completed for both studies. The original trial (number, NCT00678275) and follow-up extension (number, NCT03042676) are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. FINDINGS: In the original study, from Dec 14, 2006, to Feb 2, 2012, 161 patients were enrolled and 155 were randomly assigned to either the ATLG group (n=83) or to the non-ATLG group (n=72). In the follow-up study, which started on Feb 7, 2017, and was completed on June 30, 2017, 61 patients were included in the ATLG group and 53 were included in the non-ATLG group. Global health status showed a more favourable time course in the ATLG group compared with the non-ATLG group (p=0.02; treatment by visit interaction). ATLG was descriptively superior to non-ATLG at 24 months for physical function (points estimate -14.8 [95% CI -26.4 to -3.1]; p=0.014) and social function (-19.1 [-38.0 to -0.2]; p=0.047), gastrointestinal side-effects (8.8 [2.5-15.1]; p=0.008) and effect on family (13.5 [1.2-25.8]; p=0.032). Extended follow-up (median 5.9 years [IQR 1.7-7.9]) confirmed a lower 5-year cGVHD incidence (30.0% [95% CI 21.4-41.9] vs 69.1% [59.1-80.1]; analysis for entire follow-up, p<0.001), no increase in relapses (35.4% [26.4-47.5] vs 22.5% [14.6-34.7]; p=0.09), improved cGRFS (34.3% [24.2-44.5] vs 13.9% [7.1-22.9]; p=0.005), and fewer patients still in immunosuppression (9.6% vs 28.3%; p=0.017) in the ATLG group compared with the non-ATLG group. 5-year overall survival, relapse-free survival, and non-relapse mortality did not differ significantly between groups. INTERPRETATION: The addition of ATLG to standard GVHD prophylaxis improves the probability of surviving without disease relapse and cGVHD after myeloablative peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling donor for patients with acute leukaemia in remission. Further additional benefits are better QoL and shorter immunosuppressive treatment compared with standard GVHD prophylaxis without ATLG. Therefore, in this setting, ATLG plus standard GVHD prophylaxis should be preferred over the standard GVHD prophylaxis alone. FUNDING: Neovii Biotech.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Pharmacologic angiotensin axis blockade (AAB) has been associated with profound hypotension following anesthetic induction with propofol. To combat this problem, investigators have attempted to withhold angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) preoperatively, or evaluated the effects of different induction agents in conferring greater hemodynamic stability. To date, methohexital has not been compared with the most commonly used induction agent, propofol. Hence, the primary objective was to study the hypothesis that methohexital confers a better hemodynamic profile than propofol for anesthetic induction, in patients receiving AAB. The secondary objective was to investigate the postinduction levels of serum neurohormones in an attempt to explain the mechanisms involved. METHODS: Forty-five adult, hypertensive patients taking ACEi or ARB and scheduled for elective, noncardiac surgery completed the study. Patients were randomized to receive equi-anesthetic doses of either propofol or methohexital for anesthetic induction. Hemodynamic variables were measured and blood samples were drawn before induction and for 15 minutes afterwards. RESULTS: Methohexital resulted in less hypotension compared with propofol (P = .01), although the degree of refractory hypotension was similar (P = .37). The postinduction systolic blood pressure (P = .03), diastolic blood pressure (P < .001) and heart rate (P = .03) were significantly higher in the methohexital group. A nonsignificant elevation of serum norepinephrine and epinephrine levels was observed in the methohexital group, while serum arginine vasopressin and angiotensin II levels did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: While methohexital was shown to confer greater hemodynamic stability in patients taking ACEi/ARB, the measured hormone levels could not explain the mechanism for this effect.",

    "AB": "AIM: The purpose of the study is to prove the effectiveness of pharmacological preconditioning caused by nicorandil in patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD) during the elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 88 patients with a stable form of CHD, who were going to pass the elective PCI, in the study. As the method of blind randomization envelope method was used. There were formed two groups or patients: the first group involved 45 patients - were treated with nicorandil (Cordinic, PIQ-FHARMA LLC) (the main group) the other group included 43 patients who were treated by the standard therapy (the comparison group). The basic antianginal therapy was allowed to use in both groups: beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, ATE inhibitors / angiotensin II receptor blockers, statins, acetylsalicylic acid, blockers of P2Y12 receptor platelets. The admission of prolonged form of nitrates before the PCI was allowed in the second group. Patients from the 1st group were to take nicorandil 2 days and 1 day before the PCI at the 30 mg/day dose, then 20 mg orally 2 hours just before PCI, and one more time 6 hours after the PCI - 10 mg nicorandil. Highly sensitive troponin (HS-Tp) as a biomarker of irreversible damage to the myocardium was evaluated before PCI and after PCI in 24 hours. Were used highly sensitive troponin (HF-Tr) and creatine phosphokinase-MB as an irreversible myocardial damage biomarkers. The analysis of which was conducted before PCI and 24 hours after the surgery. RESULTS: The obtained data shows the significant differences of an increase in hs-Tp in 24 hours after PCI in patients with no admission of nicorandil (117 ng/l) as compared with the nicorandil group (73 ng/l), p = 0.04. There were significant differences in the 24 hours increment in hs-Tp in the control group, it was higher (112 ng/l) than in the nicorandil group (67 ng/l), p = 0.03. There was also a significant -decrease in CK-MB after 24 hours in the nicorandil group (2.7 ng/L) compared to the control group (2.0 ng/L), p = 0.008. Also the frequency of the troponin increase above the UNL(upper normal level) in the nicorandal group, was significantly (p = 0.03) lower (in 62% of cases compared to 85% of the control group). CONCLUSION: The prevention of the complications during the percutaneous myocardial revascularization should be considered with the position of the most suitable pharmacological support. The appointment of the oral form of nicorandil (Cordinic, PIQ-FHARMA LLC) for 2 days and 1 day before PCI 30 mg/day, then 20 mg 2 hours before the PCI and 10 mg after 6 hours after the surgery reduces the risk of intraoperative myocardial damage. The obtained data give an opportunity to extend the indications for nicorandil's appointment in the drug support during PCI in patients with stable coronary artery disease.",

    "AB": "AIMS: Cementless primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) is associated with risks of bleeding and thromboembolism. Anticoagulants are effective as venous thromboprophylaxis, but with an increased risk of bleeding. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an efficient antifibrinolytic agent, but the mode and timing of its administration remain controversial. This study aimed to determine whether two intravenous (IV) TXA regimens (a three-hour two-dose (short-TXA) and 11-hour four-dose (long-TXA)) were more effective than placebo in reducing perioperative real blood loss (RBL, between baseline and day 3 postoperatively) in patients undergoing THA who receive rivaroxaban as thromboprophylaxis. The secondary aim was to assess the non-inferiority of the reduction of blood loss of the short protocol versus the long protocol. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicentre, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was undertaken involving 229 patients undergoing primary cementless THA using a posterior approach, whose extended rivaroxaban thromboprophylaxis started on the day of surgery. There were 98 male and 131 female patients, with a mean age of 65.5 years (32 to 91). The primary outcome, perioperative RBL, was evaluated at 72 hours postoperatively. The efficacy of short- and long-TXA protocols in the reduction of perioperative RBL was compared with a placebo group. RESULTS: TXA significantly reduced perioperative blood loss compared with placebo (p < 0.001); the mean differences were 525.3 ml (short-TXA vs placebo) and 550.1 ml (long-TXA vs placebo). No venous or arterial thromboembolic complications were reported. The upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval, when comparing short and long protocols, was below the pre-specified margin of non-inferiority (p = 0.027). CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing primary cementless THA, using a posterior approach, who are treated with rivaroxaban for thromboembolic prophylaxis, short- and long-TXA IV protocols are significantly more effective than placebo in reducing perioperative RBL, without any thromboembolic complications. Non-inferiority of a short- versus a long-TXA protocol in reducing perioperative RBL was supported in a secondary analysis.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: The management of complex orthopedic infections usually includes a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotic agents. We investigated whether oral antibiotic therapy is noninferior to intravenous antibiotic therapy for this indication. METHODS: We enrolled adults who were being treated for bone or joint infection at 26 U.K. centers. Within 7 days after surgery (or, if the infection was being managed without surgery, within 7 days after the start of antibiotic treatment), participants were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous or oral antibiotics to complete the first 6 weeks of therapy. Follow-on oral antibiotics were permitted in both groups. The primary end point was definitive treatment failure within 1 year after randomization. In the analysis of the risk of the primary end point, the noninferiority margin was 7.5 percentage points. RESULTS: Among the 1054 participants (527 in each group), end-point data were available for 1015 (96.3%). Treatment failure occurred in 74 of 506 participants (14.6%) in the intravenous group and 67 of 509 participants (13.2%) in the oral group. Missing end-point data (39 participants, 3.7%) were imputed. The intention-to-treat analysis showed a difference in the risk of definitive treatment failure (oral group vs. intravenous group) of -1.4 percentage points (90% confidence interval [CI], -4.9 to 2.2; 95% CI, -5.6 to 2.9), indicating noninferiority. Complete-case, per-protocol, and sensitivity analyses supported this result. The between-group difference in the incidence of serious adverse events was not significant (146 of 527 participants [27.7%] in the intravenous group and 138 of 527 [26.2%] in the oral group; P=0.58). Catheter complications, analyzed as a secondary end point, were more common in the intravenous group (9.4% vs. 1.0%).

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Multiple arterial grafts may result in longer survival than single arterial grafts after coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. We evaluated the use of bilateral internal-thoracic-artery grafts for CABG. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients scheduled for CABG to undergo bilateral or single internal-thoracic-artery grafting. Additional arterial or vein grafts were used as indicated. The primary outcome was death from any cause at 10 years. The composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, or stroke was a secondary outcome. RESULTS: A total of 1548 patients were randomly assigned to undergo bilateral internal-thoracic-artery grafting (the bilateral-graft group) and 1554 to undergo single internal-thoracic-artery grafting (the single-graft group). In the bilateral-graft group, 13.9% of the patients received only a single internal-thoracic-artery graft, and in the single-graft group, 21.8% of the patients also received a radial-artery graft. Vital status was not known for 2.3% of the patients at 10 years. In the intention-to-treat analysis at 10 years, there were 315 deaths (20.3% of the patients) in the bilateral-graft group and 329 deaths (21.2%) in the single-graft group (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.12; P=0.62). Regarding the composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, there were 385 patients (24.9%) with an event in the bilateral-graft group and 425 patients (27.3%) with an event in the single-graft group (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.03). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who were scheduled for CABG and had been randomly assigned to undergo bilateral or single internal-thoracic-artery grafting, there was no significant between-group difference in the rate of death from any cause at 10 years in the intention-to-treat analysis. Further studies are needed to determine whether multiple arterial grafts provide better outcomes than a single internal-thoracic-artery graft.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: E-cigarettes are commonly used in attempts to stop smoking, but evidence is limited regarding their effectiveness as compared with that of nicotine products approved as smoking-cessation treatments. METHODS: We randomly assigned adults attending U.K. National Health Service stop-smoking services to either nicotine-replacement products of their choice, including product combinations, provided for up to 3 months, or an e-cigarette starter pack (a second-generation refillable e-cigarette with one bottle of nicotine e-liquid [18 mg per milliliter]), with a recommendation to purchase further e-liquids of the flavor and strength of their choice. Treatment included weekly behavioral support for at least 4 weeks. The primary outcome was sustained abstinence for 1 year, which was validated biochemically at the final visit. Participants who were lost to follow-up or did not provide biochemical validation were considered to not be abstinent. Secondary outcomes included participant-reported treatment usage and respiratory symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 886 participants underwent randomization. The 1-year abstinence rate was 18.0% in the e-cigarette group, as compared with 9.9% in the nicotine-replacement group (relative risk, 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30 to 2.58; P<0.001). Among participants with 1-year abstinence, those in the e-cigarette group were more likely than those in the nicotine-replacement group to use their assigned product at 52 weeks (80% [63 of 79 participants] vs. 9% [4 of 44 participants]). Overall, throat or mouth irritation was reported more frequently in the e-cigarette group (65.3%, vs. 51.2% in the nicotine-replacement group) and nausea more frequently in the nicotine-replacement group (37.9%, vs. 31.3% in the e-cigarette group). The e-cigarette group reported greater declines in the incidence of cough and phlegm production from baseline to 52 weeks than did the nicotine-replacement group (relative risk for cough, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6 to 0.9; relative risk for phlegm, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6 to 0.9). There were no significant between-group differences in the incidence of wheezing or shortness of breath. CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarettes were more effective for smoking cessation than nicotine-replacement therapy, when both products were accompanied by behavioral support.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of two common types of exercise training-high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT)-in adults with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: In this mixed-methods pilot trial, participants with quiescent or mildly-active CD were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to HIIT, MICT or usual care control, and followed up for 6 months. The HIIT and MICT groups were offered three exercise sessions per week for the first 12 weeks. Feasibility outcomes included rates of recruitment, retention, outcome completion, and exercise attendance. Data were collected on cardiorespiratory fitness (e.g., peak oxygen uptake), disease activity, fatigue, quality of life, adverse events, and intervention acceptability (via interviews). RESULTS: Over 17 months, 53 patients were assessed for eligibility and 36 (68%) were randomised (47% male; mean age 36.9 [SD 11.2] years); 13 to HIIT, 12 to MICT, and 11 to control. The exercise session attendance rate was 62% for HIIT (288/465) and 75% for MICT (320/429), with 62% of HIIT participants (8/13) and 67% of MICT participants (8/12) completing at least 24 of 36 sessions. One participant was lost to follow-up. Outcome completion rates ranged from 89 to 97%. The mean increase in peak oxygen uptake, relative to control, was greater following HIIT than MICT (2.4 vs. 0.7 mL/kg/min). There were three non-serious exercise-related adverse events, and two exercise participants experienced disease relapse during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the feasibility and acceptability of the exercise programmes and trial procedures. A definitive trial is warranted. Physical exercise remains a potentially useful adjunct therapy in CD. [ID: ISRCTN13021107].",

    "AB": "PURPOSE: The goal of this investigation was to define time-dependent peri-implant tissue changes at implants with different abutment interface designs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants requiring replacement of single maxillary anterior and first premolar teeth were recruited and treated under an institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocol. Implants, titanium abutments, and provisional crowns were placed in healed ridges 5 months following preservation after tooth extraction with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2). Twelve weeks later, permanent crowns were placed on patient-specific abutments and evaluated at 6, 12, and 36 months following implant placement. Clinical and radiographic assessments of abutments and crowns, peri-implant mucosa, and marginal bone levels were recorded. RESULTS: The 3-year assessment included 45 conical interface (CI), 34 flat-to-flat interface (FI), and 32 platform-switched interface (PS) implants in 111 participants. At 3 years, the mean marginal bone level (MBL) change at CI, FI, and PS implants was -0.12, -1.02, and -1.04 mm, respectively (P = .014). \"Zero\" MBL loss or gain was measured over the 3-year period at 72.1% CI, 3.0% FI, and 16.6% PS implants. There was a minor change (0.0 to 0.3 mm) in peri-implant mucosal zenith positions over time and between groups. Eighty percent of CI implants, 61% of FI implants, and 84% of PS implants were observed to have a clinically stable peri-implant mucosal zenith position with less than 0.5 mm of measured recession. Over the 36-month period, there were no significant changes in the location of mesial or distal papilla in any group. CONCLUSION: Significant differences in MBLs were observed at different implant interfaces. Conical implant interfaces, but not flat-to-flat or platform-switched implant interfaces, were associated with no MBL changes over 3 years. Peri-implant mucosal stability was generally observed.

    "AB": "Importance: There are currently no proven treatments to reduce the risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Objective: To evaluate the effect of intensive blood pressure control on risk of dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized clinical trial conducted at 102 sites in the United States and Puerto Rico among adults aged 50 years or older with hypertension but without diabetes or history of stroke. Randomization began on November 8, 2010. The trial was stopped early for benefit on its primary outcome (a composite of cardiovascular events) and all-cause mortality on August 20, 2015. The final date for follow-up of cognitive outcomes was July 22, 2018. Interventions: Participants were randomized to a systolic blood pressure goal of either less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment group; n = 4678) or less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment group; n = 4683). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary cognitive outcome was occurrence of adjudicated probable dementia. Secondary cognitive outcomes included adjudicated mild cognitive impairment and a composite outcome of mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia. Results: Among 9361 randomized participants (mean age, 67.9 years; 3332 women [35.6%]), 8563 (91.5%) completed at least 1 follow-up cognitive assessment. The median intervention period was 3.34 years. During a total median follow-up of 5.11 years, adjudicated probable dementia occurred in 149 participants in the intensive treatment group vs 176 in the standard treatment group (7.2 vs 8.6 cases per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67-1.04). Intensive BP control significantly reduced the risk of mild cognitive impairment (14.6 vs 18.3 cases per 1000 person-years; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69-0.95) and the combined rate of mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia (20.2 vs 24.1 cases per 1000 person-years; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.97). Conclusions and Relevance: Among ambulatory adults with hypertension, treating to a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 120 mm Hg compared with a goal of less than 140 mm Hg did not result in a significant reduction in the risk of probable dementia. Because of early study termination and fewer than expected cases of dementia, the study may have been underpowered for this end point.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome remains a serious complication during in vitro fertilization cycles if high dose human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is used to trigger ovulation in high responder patients. Though much of this risk is mitigated with trigger using gonadotropin releasing-hormone (GnRH) agonist alone, it may result in lower birth rates. GnRH-agonist trigger and adjuvant low dose hCG has been proposed to improve birth rates, but timing of this hCG support to corpus luteum function has never been fully described. In this randomized, prospective trial, we explore differences in live birth rates and incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in high-responder patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) receiving low dose hCG at the time of GnRH-agonist (dual trigger) or hCG adjuvant at the time of oocyte retrieval. Does the timing of hCG support make a difference? RESULTS: Thirty-four subjects high-responder patients were randomized to receive low-dose hCG at the time of GnRH-agonist trigger (Group 1) and 37 received low-dose hCG at the time of oocyte retrieval (Group 2). There were no differences in the baseline characteristics and outcome of ovarian stimulation between the two groups. There were no differences in the live birth rates between Group 1 and Group 2 by intention-to-treat (14/34, 41.2% versus 21/37, 56.8%, p = 0.19) or per-protocol (14/26, 53.8% versus 19/31, 61.3%, p = 0.57) analyses. There was a slightly higher incidence of OHSS in Group 2 compared to Group 1 although the difference was not statistically significant (3/31, 9.7% versus 1/26, 3.8%). All the cases of OHSS in Group 2 were moderate while the one case of OHSS in Group 1 was mild. CONCLUSIONS: For high responder patients receiving GnRH-agonist trigger, low dose hCG supplementation allowed high pregnancy rates after fresh embryo transfer, regardless of whether it was given at the time of trigger or at oocyte retrieval. Dual trigger may be preferable to reduce the risk of OHSS.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Molecular mechanisms linking fish and vegetable oil intakes to their healthy metabolic effects may involve attenuation of inflammation. Our primary aim was to examine in a randomized controlled setting whether diets enriched in fatty fish (FF), lean fish (LF) or ALA-rich camelina sativa oil (CSO) differ in their effects on the mRNA expression response of selected inflammation-related genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in subjects with impaired fasting glucose. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Samples from 72 participants randomized to one of the following 12-week intervention groups, FF (n = 19), LF (n = 19), CSO (n = 17) or a control group (n = 17), were available for the PBMC study. For SAT, 39 samples (n = 8, n = 10, n = 9, n = 12, respectively) were available. The mRNA expression was measured at baseline and 12 weeks by TaqMan(R) Low Density Array. RESULTS: In PBMCs, LF decreased ICAM1 mRNA expression (P < 0.05), which was different (P = 0.06, Bonferroni correction) from the observed increase in the FF group (P < 0.05). Also, compared to the control group, LF decreased ICAM1 mRNA expression (P < 0.05). Moreover, the change in ICAM1 mRNA expression correlated positively with the intake of FF (P < 0.05) and negatively with the intake of LF (P < 0.05), independently of study group. A diet enriched in CSO, a rich source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), decreased PBMC IFNG mRNA expression (P < 0.01). The intake of CSO in the CSO group, but not the increase in plasma ALA proportions, correlated inversely with the IFNG mRNA expression in PBMCs (P = 0.08). In SAT, when compared with the control group, the effect of FF on decreasing IL1RN mRNA expression was significant (P < 0.03). CONCLUSION: We propose that CSO intake may partly exert its benefits through immuno-inflammatory molecular regulation in PBMCs, while modulation of ICAM1 expression, an endothelial/vascular-related gene, may be more dependent on the type of fish consumed.",

The aim of the study was to compare the influence of orlistat (IO), metformin (IM), or calorie-restricted diet (LC) on IGF-1, with special respect to insulin-resistance status. One hundred and fourteen obese women aged from 18 to 40 years were divided into insulin sensitive (IS) and insulin resistant (IR) groups and received a low calorie diet (LC), or an isocaloric diet and 500 mg metformin twice daily (IM), or isocaloric diet with 120 mg orlistat three times daily (IO). Before and after the intervention anthropometric parameters, serum lipid profile, serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, insulin, glucose, IGF-1, HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment), and visceral adiposity index (VAI), and their changes were registered. Although the reductions in weight and body fat were comparable in IS and IR groups, only women with IR showed a significant increase in IGF-1 concentration as a result of all interventions. We found significant positive correlations of DeltaIGF-1 with initial and Delta values of: HOMA-IR, triglyceride/high-density cholesterol ratio, VAI. IR premenopausal women show significant increase in IGF-1 serum concentrations regardless the method of intervention. The increase in IGF-1 was parallel to the improvement of insulin resistance parameters.",

    "AB": "Background: Acne vulgaris (acne) is the most common dermatologic disease seen in a racially, geographically, politically, culturally, and socioeconomically diverse Hispanic population. Despite their growing demographics in the US, there are few studies evaluating acne treatment in this population. Potential for skin irritation and dryness, as well as pigmentary changes are key concerns. The first lotion formulation of tretinoin was developed using novel polymerized emulsion technology to provide an important alternative option to treat these acne patients who may be sensitive to the irritant effects of other tretinoin formulations. Objective: To determine the efficacy and safety of tretinoin 0.05% lotion in treating moderate-to-severe acne in a Hispanic population. Methods: Post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 studies in moderate or severe acne. Hispanic subjects (aged 11 to 50 years, N=766) were randomized (1:1) to receive tretinoin 0.05% lotion or vehicle, once-daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included changes in baseline inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions and treatment success (at least 2-grade reduction in Evaluator's Global Severity Score [EGSS] and clear/almost clear). Safety, adverse events (AEs), and cutaneous tolerability were evaluated throughout using a 4-point scale where 0=none and 3=severe. Results: At week 12, mean percent reduction in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts were 60.1% and 53.0%, respectively, compared with 51.1% and 38.7% with vehicle (P</=0.001) in the Hispanic population. Treatment success was achieved by 19.6% of subjects by week 12, compared with 12.7% on vehicle (P=0.015). The majority of AEs were mild and transient. There were four serious AEs (SAEs) reported (two each group) unrelated to treatment. Incidence of treatment-related AEs with tretinoin 0.05% lotion was lower than in the overall study population; the most frequently were application site pain (2.0%), dryness (1.4%), and erythema (1.2%). Local cutaneous safety and tolerability assessments were generally mild-to-moderate at baseline and improved by week 12. There were slight transient increases in scaling and burning over the first four weeks. Hyperpigmentation severity reduced progressively with treatment. Conclusions: Tretinoin 0.05% lotion was significantly more effective than its vehicle in achieving treatment success and reducing inflammatory and noninflammatory acne lesions in a Hispanic population. The new lotion formulation was well-tolerated, and all treatment-related AEs were both mild and transient in nature. J Drugs Dermatol. 2019;18(1):32-38.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Implantation failure is the main factor affecting the success rate of in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures. Studies have reported that uterine contractions (UC) at the time of embryo transfer (ET) were inversely related to implantation and pregnancy rate, hence reducing the success of IVF treatments. Various pharmacological agents, with the exception of calcium channel blockers, have been investigated to improve ET outcomes by reducing UC. Thus, a double-blinded randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to determine whether nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker with potent smooth muscle relaxing activity and an excellent safety profile, can improve the outcome of patients undergoing ET treatments. METHODS: Ninety-three infertile women were recruited into 1 of 2 groups: placebo (n = 47) or nifedipine 20 mg (n = 46). Study participants were admitted 30 minutes prior to ET and given either tablet after their baseline vital signs were recorded. They then underwent ET and were observed for adverse events for another 30 minutes post-ET. Follow up of the participants' outcomes was conducted via electronic medical records. The primary outcomes are implantation and clinical pregnancy rates. Secondary outcomes include any maternal or fetal adverse events, miscarriage, pregnancy, live births, and neonatal outcomes. Resulting data were then analyzed using t test, Pearson chi-square test, and Fisher exact test to compare outcomes between the 2 groups. RESULTS: No statistical differences in the implantation rate (42.6% vs 39.1%, P = .737, rate ratio 0.868, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.379-1.986) and the clinical pregnancy rate (23.4% vs 26.1%, P = .764, rate ratio 1.155, 95% CI: 0.450-2.966) were detected between the placebo and the treatment groups. In addition, no statistical significance between the placebo and the treatment groups for any secondary outcomes were detected. CONCLUSIONS: This double blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that the single use of 20 mg nifedipine given 30 minutes before embryo transfer did not improve the implantation rate or the clinical pregnancy rate of the infertility treatment. Further studies are required to demonstrate the clinical benefits and risks of nifedipine usage in embryo transfer.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the accuracy of the preoperative localization of small nodules by computerized tomography (CT)-guided placing wire and intrapleural fibrin glue near the nodules at 3 days before the operation. METHODS: From October 2015 to December 2017, a total of 79 patients, who received preoperative localization of small pulmonary nodules and surgical treatment in the Department of Thoracic Surgery of Hohhot First Hospital, were enrolled into this study. These patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: methylene blue localization group (n = 47), and modified localization group (n = 32), where the patients received preoperative localization of the small nodules by CT-guided placing wire and intrapleural fibrin glue near the nodule at 3 days before the operation. Localization accuracy, operation time and difficulty in postoperative seeking for pathological specimens were compared between these 2 groups. RESULTS: In the methylene blue localization group, 3 patients had localization failure due to the intrathoracic diffusion of methylene blue, and the success rate was 93.61%. In the modified localization group, all 32 patients succeeded in the localization, and the success rate was 100%. Operation time and difficulty of finding the specimen was significantly lower in the modified localization group than in the methylene blue localization group (P < .05). CONCLUSION: The application of preoperative localization of small nodules by placing wire and intrapleural fibrin glue improves the success rate of resection, reduces operation time and the risk of the operation, and lowers the difficulty of finding pathological specimens after the operation. Hence this operative procedure is worthy of popularization.",

    "AB": "PURPOSE: To study the effect of Kangfuxin liquid combined with Garlicin Capsules in treatment of children with recurrent oral ulcer (ROU) and on immunological regulation. METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical study prospectively enrolled 204 patients with ROU who were randomly divided into 2 groups. Patients in group A received Garlicin Capsules 1/time, 3 times/d, combined with Kangfuxin liquid 10 mL to gargle 3 times/d; patients in group B only received Kangfuxin liquid 10 mL gargle 5 min, 3/d. The treatment lasted for 2 weeks. The curative effect was compared before and after treatment, including ulcer surface pain (VAS score), time of ulcer healing, and the changes of T cell subsets (CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+) and CD4(+)/CD8(+)) before and after treatment were compared by SPSS 22 software package. RESULTS: Ulcer healing time (3.5+/-0.6) d, duration of pain (3.1+/-0.3)d in group A were shorter than in group B (P<0.05); treatment efficiency was 96.08% in group A, 88.24% in group B( chi(2)=6.264, P<0.05). The pain scores of both groups were significantly reduced after treatment, and the difference was significant between group A and group B [(1.1+/-0.4) vs (3.2+/- 0.6)] (P<0.05). The levels of CD3(+), CD4(+), CD4(+)/CD8(+) in group A were significantly higher than those in group A after treatment (P<0.05), the levels of CD8+ was significant lower than in group B (P<0.05). CONSLUSIONS: Kangfuxin liquid combined with Garlicin Capsules can improve the therapeutic effect of ROU and repair of local damaged mucosa in children, increasing the immune function of children.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE:: With increasing incorporation of MRI in radiotherapy, we investigate two MRI sequences for prostate delineation in radiographer-led image guidance. METHODS:: Five therapeutic radiographers contoured the prostate individually on CT, T2 weighted (T2W) and T2* weighted (T2*W) imaging for 10 patients. Contours were analysed with Monaco ADMIRE (research v. 2.0) to assess interobserver variability and accuracy by comparison with a gold standard clinician contour. Observers recorded time taken for contouring and scored image quality and confidence in contouring. RESULTS:: There is good agreement when comparing radiographer contours to the gold-standard for all three imaging types with Dice similarity co-efficient 0.91-0.94, Cohen's kappa 0.85-0.91, Hausdorff distance 4.6-7.6 mm and mean distance between contours 0.9-1.2 mm. In addition, there is good concordance between radiographers across all imaging modalities. Both T2W and T2*W MRI show reduced interobserver variability and improved accuracy compared to CT, this was statistically significant for T2*W imaging compared to CT across all four comparison metrics. Comparing MRI sequences reveals significantly reduced interobserver variability and significantly improved accuracy on T2*W compared to T2W MRI for DSC and Cohen's kappa. Both MRI sequences scored significantly higher compared to CT for image quality and confidence in contouring, particularly T2*W. This was also reflected in the shorter time for contouring, measuring 15.4, 9.6 and 9.8 min for CT, T2W and T2*W MRI respectively. Conclusion: Therapeutic radiographer prostate contours are more accurate, show less interobserver variability and are more confidently and quickly outlined on MRI compared to CT, particularly using T2*W MRI. Advances in knowledge: Our work is relevant for MRI sequence choice and development of the roles of the interprofessional team in the advancement of MRI-guided radiotherapy.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Endometrial scratching (with the use of a pipelle biopsy) is a technique proposed to facilitate embryo implantation and increase the probability of pregnancy in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial. Eligible women were undergoing IVF (fresh-embryo or frozen-embryo transfer), with no recent exposure to disruptive intrauterine instrumentation (e.g., hysteroscopy). Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either endometrial scratching (by pipelle biopsy between day 3 of the cycle preceding the embryo-transfer cycle and day 3 of the embryo-transfer cycle) or no intervention. The primary outcome was live birth. RESULTS: A total of 1364 women underwent randomization. The frequency of live birth was 180 of 690 women (26.1%) in the endometrial-scratch group and 176 of 674 women (26.1%) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.27). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, or miscarriage. The median score for pain from endometrial scratching (on a scale of 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating worse pain) was 3.5 (interquartile range, 1.9 to 6.0). CONCLUSIONS: Endometrial scratching did not result in a higher rate of live birth than no intervention among women undergoing IVF.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Levodopa is the main treatment for symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Determining whether levodopa also has a disease-modifying effect could provide guidance as to when in the course of the disease the treatment with this drug should be initiated. METHODS: In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-start trial, we randomly assigned patients with early Parkinson's disease to receive levodopa (100 mg three times per day) in combination with carbidopa (25 mg three times per day) for 80 weeks (early-start group) or placebo for 40 weeks followed by levodopa in combination with carbidopa for 40 weeks (delayed-start group). The primary outcome was the between-group difference in the mean change from baseline to week 80 in the total score on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS; scores range from 0 to 176, with higher scores signifying more severe disease). Secondary analyses included the progression of symptoms, as measured by the UPDRS score, between weeks 4 and 40 and the noninferiority of early initiation of treatment to delayed initiation between weeks 44 and 80, with a noninferiority margin of 0.055 points per week. RESULTS: A total of 445 patients were randomly assigned: 222 to the early-start group and 223 to the delayed-start group. The mean (+/-SD) UPDRS score at baseline was 28.1+/-11.4 points in the early-start group and 29.3+/-12.1 points in the delayed-start group. The change in UPDRS score from baseline to week 80 was -1.0+/-13.1 points and -2.0+/-13.0 points, respectively (difference, 1.0 point; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.5 to 3.5; P=0.44); this finding of no significant between-group difference at week 80 implies that levodopa had no disease-modifying effect. Between weeks 4 and 40, the rate of progression of symptoms, as measured in UPDRS points per week, was 0.04+/-0.23 in the early-start group and 0.06+/-0.34 in the delayed-start group (difference, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.03). The corresponding rates between weeks 44 and 80 were 0.10+/-0.25 and 0.03+/-0.28 (difference, 0.07; two-sided 90% CI, 0.03 to 0.10); the difference in the rate of progression between weeks 44 and 80 did not meet the criterion for noninferiority of early receipt of levodopa to delayed receipt. The rates of dyskinesia and levodopa-related fluctuations in motor response did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with early Parkinson's disease who were evaluated over the course of 80 weeks, treatment with levodopa in combination with carbidopa had no disease-modifying effect.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Dyslipidemia is one of the most frequently implicated risk factors for development of atherosclerosis. This study evaluated the efficacy of amla (Emblica officinalis) extract (composed of polyphenols, triterpenoids, oils etc. as found in the fresh wild amla fruit) in patients with dyslipidemia. METHODS: A total of 98 dyslipidemic patients were enrolled and divided into amla and placebo groups. Amla extract (500 mg) or a matching placebo capsule was administered twice daily for 12 weeks to the respective group of patients. The patients were followed up for 12 weeks and efficacy of study medication was assessed by analyzing lipid profile. Other parameters evaluated were apolipoprotein B (Apo B), apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1), Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fasting blood sugar (FBS), homocysteine and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). RESULTS: In 12 weeks, the major lipids such as total cholesterol (TC) (p = 0.0003), triglyceride (TG) (p = 0.0003), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (p = 0.0064) and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) (p = 0.0001) were significantly lower in amla group as compared to placebo group. Additionally, a 39% reduction in atherogenic index of the plasma (AIP) (p = 0.0177) was also noted in amla group. The ratio of Apo B to Apo A1 was reduced more (p = 0.0866) in the amla group as compared to the placebo. There was no significant change in CoQ10 level of amla (p = 0.2942) or placebo groups (p = 0.6744). Although there was a general trend of FBS reduction, the numbers of participants who may be classified as pre-diabetes and diabetes groups (FBS > 100 mg/dl) in the amla group were only 8. These results show that the amla extract used in the study is potentially a hypoglycaemic as well. However, this needs reconfirmation in a larger study. CONCLUSIONS: The Amla extract has shown significant potential in reducing TC and TG levels as well as lipid ratios, AIP and apoB/apo A-I in dyslipidemic persons and thus has scope to treat general as well as diabetic dyslipidemia. A single agent to reduce cholesterol as well as TG is rare. Cholesterol reduction is achieved without concomitant reduction of Co Q10, in contrast to what is observed with statins.

    "AB": "PURPOSE: Clinical implications of single patient classifier (SPC) and microsatellite instability (MSI) in stage II/III gastric cancer have been reported. We investigated SPC and the status of MSI and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as combinatory biomarkers to predict the prognosis and responsiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II/III gastric cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor specimens and clinical information were collected from patients enrolled in CLASSIC trial, a randomized controlled study of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. The results of nine-gene based SPC assay were classified as prognostication (SPC-prognosis) and prediction of chemotherapy benefit (SPC-prediction). Five quasimonomorphic mononucleotide markers were used to assess tumor MSI status. EBV-encoded small RNA in situ hybridization was performed to define EBV status. RESULTS: There were positive associations among SPC, MSI, and EBV statuses among 586 patients. In multivariate analysis of disease-free survival, SPC-prognosis [hazard ratio (HR): 1.879 (1.101-3.205), 2.399 (1.415-4.067), p=0.003] and MSI status (HR: 0.363, 95% confidence interval: 0.161-0.820, p=0.015) were independent prognostic factors along with age, Lauren classification, TNM stage, and chemotherapy. Patient survival of SPC-prognosis was well stratified regardless of EBV status and in microsatellite stable (MSS) group, but not in MSI-high group. Significant survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy was observed by SPC-Prediction in MSS and EBV-negative gastric cancer. CONCLUSION: SPC, MSI, and EBV statuses could be used in combination to predict the prognosis and responsiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II/III gastric cancer.",

    "AB": "Objective: The aim of this clinical trial was to assess whether controlled irrigation with three different irrigation regimens with different temperature would result in reduction of post-endodontic pain after one-visit root canal treatment (RCT). Materials and Methods: A total of 240 (129 females and 111 male) aged 18 - 65 years were referred and integrated in this clinical trial, All patients presented with a vital maxillary or mandibular molar, premolar or front teeth designated for conventional root canal treatment for prosthetic reasons detected with only vital pulps. All canals were cleaned and shaped with Reciproc instruments, and were used with a micro motor (VDW, Munich Germany). Final irrigation was done with cold (4 degrees C, 2.5 degrees C, and room temperature) 17% EDTA and 10 mL of cold saline solution. Results: A total of 240 of 279 patients (129 females and 111 male) aged 18 - 65 years were referred and integrated in this clinical trial, whereas 29 were rejected as not completing the requirements needed. All patients presented with a vital maxillary or mandibular molar, premolar, or front teeth designated for intentional endodontic RCT for prosthetic reasons. No statistically significant difference (P > 0.05) among the groups was found regarding degree or duration of pain. There was no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05) among the 4(o)C and 2.5(o)C groups. Conclusion: The approach in both selecting the patients participating in the study and analyzing the data in this randomized clinical trial allows us to conclude that cryotherapy is an aid of clinical procedures to clean and shape the canals to reduce the occurrence of postendodontic pain and the need for medication in patients presenting with a diagnosis of vital pulp.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Ascorbic acid is a water-soluble chain breaking antioxidant. It scavenges free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are produced during metabolic pathways. Exercise can produce an imbalance between ROS and antioxidants, leading to oxidative stress-related tissue damages. This study was designed to determine the effects of ascorbic acid supplementation on circulating biomarkers of oxidative stress and muscle damage following a single bout of exercise. METHODS: In a crossover design with a 1 wk. wash-out period, 19 healthy women performed 30 min moderate-intensity cycling after ingesting 1000 mg of ascorbic acid (AA) or placebo. Blood samples were taken immediately before, immediately after and 30 min post-exercise to determine plasma albumin, total protein, glucose, oxidative stress and muscle damage markers. RESULTS: Plasma albumin and total protein levels increased immediately after exercise in placebo alongside slight reductions in glucose (p = 0.001). These effects were absent in AA cohort. Ferric reducing ability of plasma and vitamin C levels in AA cohort significantly increased after exercise (p < 0.05). Superoxide dismutase activity was significantly elevated after exercise (p = 0.002) in placebo but not AA. Plasma malondialdehyde did not change after exercise in placebo but was significantly decreased in AA (p < 0.05). The exercise protocol promoted slight muscle damage, reflected in significant increases in total creatine kinase in all subjects after exercise. On the other hand, plasma C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with ascorbic acid prior exercise improves antioxidant power but does not prevent muscle damage.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of vitamin D and probiotic co-administration on mental health, hormonal, inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). METHODS: This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out on 60 subjects, aged 18-40 years old. Subjects were randomly allocated to take either 50,000 IU vitamin D every 2 weeks plus 8 x 10(9) CFU/day probiotic (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Vitamin D and probiotic co-supplementation, compared with the placebo, significantly improved beck depression inventory [beta (difference in the mean of outcomes measures between treatment groups) - 0.58; 95% CI, - 1.15, - 0.02; P = 0.04], general health questionnaire scores (beta - 0.93; 95% CI, - 1.78, - 0.08; P = 0.03) and depression, anxiety and stress scale scores (beta - 0.90; 95% CI, - 1.67, - 0.13; P = 0.02). Vitamin D and probiotic co-supplementation was associated with a significant reduction in total testosterone (beta - 0.19 ng/mL; 95% CI, - 0.28, - 0.10; P < 0.001), hirsutism (beta - 0.95; 95% CI, - 1.39, - 0.51; P < 0.001), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (beta - 0.67 mg/L; 95% CI, - 0.97, - 0.38; P < 0.001) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (beta - 0.25 mumol/L; 95% CI, - 0.40, - 0.10; P = 0.001), and a significant increase in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (beta 82.81 mmol/L; 95% CI, 42.86, 122.75; P < 0.001) and total glutathione (GSH) levels (beta 40.42 mumol/L; 95% CI, 4.69, 76.19; P = 0.02), compared with the placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the co-administration of vitamin D and probiotic for 12 weeks to women with PCOS had beneficial effects on mental health parameters, serum total testosterone, hirsutism, hs-CRP, plasma TAC, GSH and MDA levels.

    "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Noggin is an antagonist of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and has a strong effect on osteogenesis. Osteoporosis is a common complication of transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) and denosumab has been recently emerged as a promising therapeutic option. This was a post hoc investigation of serum noggin levels among TDT patients with osteoporosis who participated in a randomized, placebo-control, phase 2b study. METHODS: Patients received either 60 mg denosumab (n = 32) or placebo (n = 31) every 6 months for 12 months. Noggin was measured, for the first time in thalassemia patients, at baseline and at 12 months, using a recently developed high sensitivity fluorescent immunoassay. RESULTS: Both groups showed a significant increase in noggin serum levels (denosumab p < 0.001; placebo p < 0.0001). Interestingly, the increase was higher in the placebo group. Furthermore, we observed a strong correlation between noggin and wrist bone mineral density (r = -0.641, p = 0.002) only in the denosumab group. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, higher noggin levels reflected more BMP inhibition, since our assay detects free bioactive noggin, which in turn impaired bone formation in placebo group. Therefore, denosumab possibly regulates noggin and favours bone turnover in TDT patients with osteoporosis through a novel mechanism of action.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Scorpion envenomation and its consequences represented a serious healthcare problem in Upper Egypt and considered to be an important cause of life-threatening emergency particularly in children. METHODS: One hundred patients presented to the emergency department of Assiut University Children Hospital with a history of scorpion sting aged less than 18 years were included in our randomized comparative trial during 2016. Two groups of patients were randomly categorized according to the route of administration of scorpion antivenom; intramuscular and intravenous with 50 patients in each group. Full history, clinical examination, and routine baseline investigations were performed. RESULTS: Myocarditis, encephalopathy, cardiogenic shock, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, mean hospital stay and mortality were significantly lower in those received intravenous antivenom compared with those received intramuscular one. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study and other experimental and clinical trials confirmed that the administration of the scorpion antivenom by intravenous route has a lower incidence of systemic toxicity, a better outcome of fatal complication resulted from envenomation especially cardiogenic shock, decreased need for ICU facilities and mechanical ventilation, shorter hospital stay, and better overall outcome than the intramuscular route.

    "AB": "Background/aim: In South Africa, contextual factors have been identified as barriers to outdoor, unstructured play. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and resulting progressive HIV encephalopathy (PHE) is a pandemic in this area, associated with development delays that are not addressed by highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART). This study aimed to describe the playfulness in children with HIV and PHE on HAART living in challenging socioeconomic areas in South Africa aged 6 months to 8 years and to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a play-informed, caregiver-implemented, home-based intervention (PICIHBI) for improving play. Methods: A feasibility randomized control trial allowed for comparison of PICIHBI and conventional one-on-one occupational therapy interventions. Children were filmed playing pre-, mid-, and postintervention, using the Test of Playfulness (ToP) to assess playfulness. The PICIHBI comprised of 10 monthly sessions facilitated by an occupational therapist, involving group discussions with caregivers and periods of experiential play. Results: Twenty-four children with HIV and/or PHE were randomized into one of the two intervention groups. Overall, the group (n = 24) had a median score of 0 (lowest item score) on nine of 24 ToP items and only had a median score of 3 (highest score) on two items. Pre- to postintervention overall ToP scores improved marginally for the PICIHBI group (n = 12) and the conventional group (n = 12). Between-group differences were not significant. The PICIHBI group demonstrated a significant increase in one ToP item score at midassessment. No significant ToP item changes were found in the conventional group. Conclusion: Children with HIV were found to have the most difficulty on ToP items relating to the play elements of internal control and freedom from constraints of reality. The PICIHBI did not significantly improve children's play and was not more effective than the conventional intervention. Considerations for feasibility and effectiveness, including barriers to attendance, are discussed.",

METHODS: Older breast cancer survivors were randomized into two groups: combined training: resistance + aerobic exercise program for nine months (n = 18) or control group (n = 18). Quality of life was assessed by the questionnaires SF36, EORTC QLQ-C30, and EORTC QLQ-BR23 at baseline, and at three, six, and nine months. The exercise group performed 40 min of resistance exercises on machines followed by 30 min of aerobic training on a treadmill 3x/wk. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare the groups over time. RESULTS: Significant time x group interactions and moderate to high effect sizes were found for physical functioning, physical health, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, fatigue, sleep disturbance, body image, and upset by hair loss, favoring the exercise group. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the potential benefits and high clinical relevance of exercise programs to improve quality of life in older breast cancer survivors undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infected patients requires special case management. AmBisome monotherapy at 40 mg/kg is recommended by the World Health Organization. The objective of the study was to assess if a combination of a lower dose of AmBisome with miltefosine would show acceptable efficacy at the end of treatment. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An open-label, non-comparative randomized trial of AmBisome (30 mg/kg) with miltefosine (100 mg/day for 28 days), and AmBisome monotherapy (40 mg/kg) was conducted in Ethiopian VL patients co-infected with HIV (NCT02011958). A sequential design was used with a triangular continuation region. The primary outcome was parasite clearance at day 29, after the first round of treatment. Patients with clinical improvement but without parasite clearance at day 29 received a second round of the allocated treatment. Efficacy was evaluated again at day 58, after completion of treatment. Recruitment was stopped after inclusion of 19 and 39 patients in monotherapy and combination arms respectively, as per pre-specified stopping rules. At D29, intention-to-treat efficacy in the AmBisome arm was 70% (95% CI 45-87%) in the unadjusted analysis, and 50% (95% CI 27-73%) in the adjusted analysis, while in the combination arm, it was 81% (95% CI 67-90%) and 67% (95% CI 48-82%) respectively. At D58, the adjusted efficacy was 55% (95% CI 32-78%) in the monotherapy arm, and 88% (95% CI 79-98%) in the combination arm. No major safety concerns related to the study medication were identified. Ten SAEs were observed within the treatment period, and 4 deaths unrelated to the study medication. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The extended treatment strategy with the combination regimen showed the highest documented efficacy in HIV-VL patients; these results support a recommendation of this regimen as first-line treatment strategy for HIV-VL patients in eastern Africa.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Pre- and co-administration of remifentanil in target-controlled propofol and remifentanil anesthesia are the most common methods in clinical practice. However, anesthesia induction time by timing remifentanil administration was not identified. Therefore, we investigated the induction time of anesthesia based on type of remifentanil administration in target-controlled anesthesia. METHODS: A total of 60 patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: Pre-administered with remifentanil before propofol infusion (Group R, n = 30) and co-administered with remifentanil with propofol (Group N, n = 30). The primary outcome was total induction time based on the order of remifentanil administration. Secondary outcomes were from start of the propofol infusion time to loss of consciousness (LOC), rocuronium onset time, time to Bispectral index (BIS) 60, and hemodynamic variables. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD of total induction time was 180.5 +/- 49.0 s in Group N and 246.3 +/- 64.7 s in Group R (mean difference: 65.8 seconds; 95% CI: 35.0-96.5 s, P < .01). Time to BIS 60 and rocuronium onset time were longer in the Group R (P < .01 and P < .01, respectively). The Deltaheart rate and Deltacardiac output values were lower in the Group R (P = .02 and P = .04, respectively). Injection pain was reported by 11 of 28 (39%) in the Group N and in 2 of 28 (7%) in the Group R (difference in proportion: 32%, 95% CI: 10-51%, P = .01). CONCLUSION: Pre-administration of remifentanil in target-controlled propofol and remifentanil anesthesia prolongs total induction time about 35% compared to co-administration of remifentanil and propofol by decreased CO.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Micronutrient deficiencies are common during pregnancy, especially in pregnant women from economically disadvantaged settings where diets with low content of minerals and vitamins are consumed. Selenium is a non-metallic chemical element of great importance to human health. This study will assess the effect of selenium supplementation on major pregnancy outcomes and disease progression among HIV-infected pregnant women in Lagos, Nigeria. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving confirmed HIV-positive pregnant women at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) between September 2018 and February 2019. Eligible participants are HIV-infected pregnant women aged 15 to 49 years and have a singleton gestation at 14 to 27 weeks' gestation. At enrolment, 90 women will be randomly assigned into each intervention arm to receive either a daily tablet of 200 mug elemental selenium or placebo. Relevant participants' data will be collected at enrolment and at delivery. Statistical analyses will be carried out using SPSS version 23.0 for Windows. The associations between any 2 groups of continuous variables will be tested using the t test or the Mann-Whitney U test and that of 2 groups of categorical variables with chi-square or Fishers exact test where appropriate. A series of multivariable analyses will also be carried out to identify and control for several possible confounders of the major pregnancy outcomes and HIV disease progression. Statistical significance will be defined as P < .05. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the LUTH's Health Research and Ethics Committee (Approval number: ADM/DCST/HREC/APP/2438; 30th August 2018). DISCUSSION: This trial will assess the effect of selenium supplementation on pregnancy outcome and HIV disease progression among HIV-infected pregnant women in Lagos. This will help to determine if routine selenium supplementation in HIV-infected pregnant women will contribute to the improvement in the major adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth and low birth weight and the HIV disease surrogate markers such as CD4+ cells count and viral load.

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To verify the effectiveness of brief group intervention, performed by nurses, in reducing the hazardous or harmful alcohol use in users of a primary health care service. METHODS: Clinical and randomized trial with follow-up of three months. The sample had 180 individuals with a pattern of hazardous or harmful alcohol use, recruited in a Basic Health Unit in the city of Sao Paulo. A sociodemographic questionnaire and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (Audit) were applied. The experimental group underwent the Brief Group Intervention, which had four group sessions, with weekly meetings. The control group received an information leaflet about issues related to alcohol consumption. Both groups participated in the follow-up of three months. The linear mixed model was used for data analysis, in which a 5% significance level was adopted. RESULTS: Forty-four individuals under hazardous or harmful alcohol use completed all phases of the research. The experimental group had a statistically significant reduction (p < 0.01) of about 10 points in Audit score after the brief group intervention [before BGI = 15.89 (SD = 6.62) - hazardous use; after BGI = 6.40 (SD = 5.05) - low hazardous use] maintaining the low hazardous use in follow-up [6.69 (SD = 6.38) - low hazardous use]. The control group had a statistically significant reduction (p </= 0.01) of about three points in Audit score [before BGI = 13.11 (SD = 4.54) - hazardous use; after BGI = 9.83 (SD = 5.54) - hazardous use] and in follow-up presented the mean score of 13.00 (SD = 5.70), indicative of hazardous use. Differences between the two groups (experimental group versus control group) in reduction of consumption were statistically significant (p </= 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our evidence showed that the brief group intervention performed by the nurse in the primary health care context was effective to reduce alcohol consumption in individuals with patterns of hazardous or harmful use.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Tafenoquine, a single-dose therapy for Plasmodium vivax malaria, has been associated with relapse prevention through the clearance of P. vivax parasitemia and hypnozoites, termed \"radical cure.\" METHODS: We performed a phase 3, prospective, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, controlled trial to compare tafenoquine with primaquine in terms of safety and efficacy. The trial was conducted at seven hospitals or clinics in Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Vietnam, and Thailand and involved patients with normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme activity and female patients with moderate G6PD enzyme deficiency; all patients had confirmed P. vivax parasitemia. The patients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive a single 300-mg dose of tafenoquine or 15 mg of primaquine once daily for 14 days (administered under supervision); all patients received a 3-day course of chloroquine and were followed for 180 days. The primary safety outcome was a protocol-defined decrease in the hemoglobin level (>3.0 g per deciliter or >/=30% from baseline or to a level of <6.0 g per deciliter). Freedom from recurrence of P. vivax parasitemia at 6 months was the primary efficacy outcome in a planned patient-level meta-analysis of the current trial and another phase 3 trial of tafenoquine and primaquine (per-protocol populations), and an odds ratio for recurrence of 1.45 (tafenoquine vs. primaquine) was used as a noninferiority margin. RESULTS: A protocol-defined decrease in the hemoglobin level occurred in 4 of 166 patients (2.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9 to 6.0) in the tafenoquine group and in 1 of 85 patients (1.2%; 95% CI, 0.2 to 6.4) in the primaquine group, for a between-group difference of 1.2 percentage points (95% CI, -4.2 to 5.0). In the patient-level meta-analysis, the percentage of patients who were free from recurrence at 6 months was 67.0% (95% CI, 61.0 to 72.3) among the 426 patients in the tafenoquine group and 72.8% (95% CI, 65.6 to 78.8) among the 214 patients in the primaquine group. The efficacy of tafenoquine was not shown to be noninferior to that of primaquine (odds ratio for recurrence, 1.81; 95% CI, 0.82 to 3.96). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with normal G6PD enzyme activity, the decline in hemoglobin level with tafenoquine did not differ significantly from that with primaquine. Tafenoquine showed efficacy for the radical cure of P. vivax malaria, although tafenoquine was not shown to be noninferior to primaquine.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Treatment of Plasmodium vivax malaria requires the clearing of asexual parasites, but relapse can be prevented only if dormant hypnozoites are cleared from the liver (a treatment termed \"radical cure\"). Tafenoquine is a single-dose 8-aminoquinoline that has recently been registered for the radical cure of P. vivax. METHODS: This multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Ethiopia, Peru, Brazil, Cambodia, Thailand, and the Philippines. We enrolled 522 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax infection (>100 to <100,000 parasites per microliter) and normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity (with normal activity defined as >/=70% of the median value determined at each trial site among 36 healthy male volunteers who were otherwise not involved in the trial). All patients received a 3-day course of chloroquine (total dose of 1500 mg). In addition, patients were assigned to receive a single 300-mg dose of tafenoquine on day 1 or 2 (260 patients), placebo (133 patients), or a 15-mg dose of primaquine once daily for 14 days (129 patients). The primary outcome was the Kaplan-Meier estimated percentage of patients who were free from recurrence at 6 months, defined as P. vivax clearance without recurrent parasitemia. RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat population, the percentage of patients who were free from recurrence at 6 months was 62.4% in the tafenoquine group (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.9 to 69.0), 27.7% in the placebo group (95% CI, 19.6 to 36.6), and 69.6% in the primaquine group (95% CI, 60.2 to 77.1). The hazard ratio for the risk of recurrence was 0.30 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.40) with tafenoquine as compared with placebo (P<0.001) and 0.26 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.39) with primaquine as compared with placebo (P<0.001). Tafenoquine was associated with asymptomatic declines in hemoglobin levels, which resolved without intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose tafenoquine resulted in a significantly lower risk of P. vivax recurrence than placebo in patients with phenotypically normal G6PD activity.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Research has demonstrated that low fermentable oligiosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diets improve gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome sufferers. Exercise-related GI issues are a common cause of underperformance, with current evidence focusing on the use of FODMAP approaches with recreationally competitive or highly trained athletes. However, there is a paucity of research exploring the potential benefit of FODMAP strategies to support healthy, recreational athletes who experience GI issues during training. This study therefore aimed to assess whether a short-term LOWFODMAP diet improved exercise-related GI symptoms and the perceived ability to exercise in recreational runners. METHODS: Sixteen healthy volunteers were randomly assigned in a crossover design manner to either a LOWFODMAP (16.06 +/- 1.79 g.d(- 1)) or HIGHFODMAP (38.65 +/- 6.66 g.d(- 1)) diet for 7 days, with a one week washout period followed by a further 7 days on the alternate diet. Participants rated their gastrointestinal symptoms on an adapted version of the Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) questionnaire before and at the end of each dietary period. Perceived ability to exercise (frequency, intensity and duration) in relation to each dietary period was also rated using a visual analogue scale. Resting blood samples were collected prior to and on completion of each diet to determine plasma intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) as a marker of acute GI injury. RESULTS: Overall IBS-SSS score significantly reduced in the LOWFODMAP condition from 81.1 +/- 16.4 to 31.3 +/- 9.2 (arbitrary units; P = 0.004). Perceived exercise frequency (z = 2.309, P = 0.02) and intensity (z = 2.687, P = 0.007) was significantly improved following a short-term LOWFODMAP approach compared to HIGHFODMAP. No significant differences were reported between dietary conditions for plasma I-FABP (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A short-term LOWFODMAP diet under free-living conditions reduced exercise-related GI symptoms and improved the perceived ability to exercise in otherwise healthy, recreational runners. These findings may be explained by a reduction in indigestible carbohydrates available for fermentation in the gut. The therapeutic benefits of LOWFODMAP diets in recreational and trained athletes during sustained training periods warrants further investigation.",

Methods: A total of 60 patients with silicosis complicated by stable COPD who were hospitalized in Department of Occupational Diseases, Laigang Hospital Affiliated to Taishan Medical College, from August 2017 to April 2018 were enrolled and randomly divided into control group and observation group, with 30 patients in each group. The patients in the control group were given routine treatment and respiratory function exercise, and those in the observation group were given nursing intervention in addition to the treatment in the control group. The two groups were compared in terms of pulmonary function, blood gas parameters, and six-minute walk distance before intervention and after 2 months of intervention. Results: After intervention, the observation group had significantly higher forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) , forced vital capacity (FVC) , arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)) , and six-minute walk distance than the control group (P<0.05) , while there were no significant differences between the two groups in FEV(1)/FVC and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P>0.05) . Conclusion: Nursing intervention can effectively improve FEV(1), FVC, PaO(2), and 6-minute walking distance in patients with silicosis complicated by stable COPD.",

    "AB": "Overweight and obesity are a global concern. Meal replacements (MRs) are portion- and calorie-controlled meals, which make the food environment part of an individual's weight loss regimen. White sweet potato (WSP; Ipomoea batatas L.), used in traditional medicine in Brazil, Japan, and Taiwan, is a healthy carbohydrate source. In this randomized controlled trial, we assessed the effects of a WSP formula on body weight management in 58 white-collar workers through MR to elucidate the effects of this WSP-MR on factors leading to overweight. The participants consumed either two packs a day for a total of 132 g of WSP (WSP-MR group) or a normal diet daily (non-WSP group) for eight weeks. After eight weeks, body weight, body fat, body mass index, wrist circumference, thigh circumference, calf circumference, mid-arm circumference, and triceps skinfolds decreased significantly in both the groups. Moreover, the WSP-MR group demonstrated a 5% decrease in body weight, body fat, body mass index, and mid-arm circumference and a 3.5% decrease in glycated hemoglobin levels (p < 0.05). The treatment was well tolerated, without side effects or adverse events. Thus, our WSP formula as an MR can facilitate individual weight loss and thus has commercial application in the food industry.",

Our aim is to assess the effectiveness of a multifactorial intervention to improve adherence to the MD, diet quality and biomedical parameters. The EMID study is a randomized and controlled clinical trial with two parallel groups and a 12-month follow-up period. The study included 204 subjects between 25(-)70 years with T2DM. The participants were randomized into intervention group (IG) and control group (CG). Both groups received brief advice about healthy eating and physical activity. The IG participants additionally took part in a food workshop, five walks and received a smartphone application for three months. The population studied had a mean age of 60.6 years. At the 3-month follow-up visit, there were improvements in adherence to the MD and diet quality of 2.2 and 2.5 points, compared to the baseline visit, respectively, in favour of the IG. This tendency of the improvement was maintained, in favour of the IG, at the 12-month follow-up visit. In conclusion, the multifactorial intervention performed could improve adherence to the MD and diet quality among patients with T2DM.",

Methods: Between June 2015 and January 2017, 53 patients with high risk of vertebral \"shell\" after thoracolumbar fracture surgery were enrolled in a prospective study according to the selection criteria. All patients were randomly divided into two groups according to the order of treatment, 27 cases in the treatment group were treated with short-segment fixation combined with vertebral reconstruction, 26 cases in the control group were treated with short-segment fixation. There was no significant difference in gender, age, injury cause, Denis classification, fracture segment, the degree of injured vertebra compression, bone mineral density, and American Spinal Cord Injury Association (ASIA) classification between the two groups ( P>0.05). The degree of injured vertebra compression, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, and Oswestry disability index (ODI) score at preoperation, immediate after operation, and last follow-up were calculated and compared between the two groups. The \"shell\" phenomenon and surgery complications were observed at the same time. Results: All patients were followed up 12-18 months with an average of 14.4 months. There were 5 cases of \"shell\" phenomenon in the treatment group and 4 cases of nonunion at last follow-up, 23 cases of \"shell\" phenomenon in the control group and 19 cases of nonunion at last follow-up; there was a significant difference between the two groups ( P<0.05). In the treatment group, 1 case had incision fat liquefaction and 4 cases had bone cement leakage; in the control group, 2 cases had screw loosening and 1 case had unilateral connecting rod rupture; there was no significant difference in the incidence of complications between the two groups ( chi (2)=0.504, P=0.478). The degree of injured vertebra compression, VAS score, and ODI score were significantly improved in both groups at immediate after operation and last follow-up ( P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the degree of injured vertebra compression between the two groups at immediate after operation ( P>0.05), but which was significantly higher in the control group than that in the treatment group at last follow-up ( P<0.05). Except that the ODI score of the control group was significantly higher than that of the treatment group at last follow-up ( P<0.05), there was no significant difference in VAS score and ODI score between the two groups at the other time points ( P>0.05). Conclusion: The treatment of thoracolumbar fracture with short-segment fixation combined with injured vertebral reconstruction can effectively prevent the \"shell\" phenomenon, which is conducive to maintaining the height of injured vertebral and improving the long-term function. The effectiveness is satisfactory.",

    "AB": "Introduction: Videoconferencing has been employed in numerous medical education settings ranging from remote supervision of medical trainees to conducting residency interviews. However, no studies have yet documented the utility of and student response to videoconference meetings for mid-clerkship feedback (MCF) sessions required by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). Methods: From March 2017 to June 2018, third-year medical students rotating through the mandatory, four-week emergency medicine (EM) clerkship at a single medical school were randomly assigned either to a web-based videoconference meeting via Google Hangouts, or to a traditional in-person meeting for their MCF session. To compare students' MCF experiences we sent out an electronic survey afterward to assess the following using a 0-100 sliding scale: overall satisfaction with the meeting; the effectiveness of communication; the helpfulness of the meeting; their stress levels, and the convenience of their meeting location. The survey also collected data on these demographic variables: the name of the faculty member with whom the student met; student gender, age, and interest in EM; location prior to meeting; meeting-method preference; and number of EM shifts completed. Results: During the study period, 133 third-year medical students responded to the survey. When comparing survey responses between individuals who met online and in person, we did not detect a difference in demographics with the exception of preferred meeting method (p=0.0225). We found no significant differences in the overall experience, helpfulness of the meeting, or stress levels of the meeting between those who met via videoconference vs. in-person (p=0.9909; p=0.8420; p=0.2352, respectively). However, individuals who met in-person with a faculty member rated effectiveness of communication higher than those who met via videoconference (p=0.0002), while those who met online rated convenience higher than those who met in-person (p<0.0001). Both effects remained significant after controlling for preferred meeting method (p<0.0001 and p=0.0003, respectively) and among EM-bound students (p=.0423 and p<0.0110, respectively). Conclusion: Our results suggest that LCME-required MCF sessions can be successfully conducted via web-based programs such as Google Hangouts without jeopardizing overall meeting experience. While the convenience of the meetings was improved, it is also important for clerkship directors to note the perceived deficit in the effectiveness of communication with videoconferencing.",

    "AB": "Introduction: Most medical schools teach cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) during the final year in course curriculum to prepare students to manage the first minutes of clinical emergencies. Little is known regarding the optimal method of instruction for this critical skill. Simulation has been shown in similar settings to enhance performance and knowledge. We evaluated the comparative effectiveness of high-fidelity simulation training vs. standard manikin training for teaching medical students the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for high-quality CPR. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, parallel-arm study of 70 fourth-year medical students to either simulation (SIM) or standard training (STD) over an eight-month period. SIM group learned the AHA guidelines for high-quality CPR via an hour session that included a PowerPoint lecture with training on a high-fidelity simulator. STD group learned identical content using a low-fidelity Resusci Anne(R) CPR manikin. All students managed a simulated cardiac arrest scenario with primary outcome based on the AHA guidelines definition of high-quality CPR (specifies metrics for compression rate, depth, recoil, and compression fraction). Secondary outcome was time to emergency medical services (EMS) activation. We analyzed data via Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. Outcomes were performed on a simulated cardiac arrest case adapted from the AHA Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) SimMan(R) Scenario manual. Results: Students in the SIM group performed CPR that more closely adhered to the AHA guidelines of compression depth and compression fraction. Mean compression depth was 4.57 centimeters (cm) (95% confidence interval [CI] [4.30-4.82]) for SIM and 3.89 cm (95% CI [3.50-4.27]) for STD, p=0.02. Mean compression fraction was 0.724 (95% CI [0.699-0.751]) for SIM group and 0.679 (95% CI [0.655-0.702]) for STD, p=0.01. There was no difference for compression rate or recoil between groups. Time to EMS activation was 24.7 seconds (s) (95% CI [15.7-40.8]) for SIM group and 79.5 s (95% CI [44.8-119.6]) for STD group, p=0.007. Conclusion: High-fidelity simulation training is superior to low-fidelity CPR manikin training for teaching fourth-year medical students implementation of high-quality CPR for chest compression depth and compression fraction.",

    "AB": "Patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) were reported to suffer from hypogeusia that affects quality of life. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is a useful drug in the treatment of LPR, but its effect on hypogeusia is not known. We therefore assessed the effects of PPI or a histamine H2 receptor antagonist (H2 blocker) on hypogeusia among patients with LPR. Both PPI and H2 blocker could inhibit acid reflux. LPR was diagnosed with reflux finding score and reflux symptom index. The visual analogue scale (VAS) of taste disturbance symptoms and the gustatory tests were assessed before and 8 weeks after treatment with esomeprazole, a PPI (20 patients, aged 50.0 +/- 1.7 years) or famotidine, a H2 blocker (20 patients, aged 47.1 +/- 1.8 years). There were no significant differences in VAS scores and recognition thresholds for four basic tastes between the two groups before treatment. Only PPI therapy significantly decreased the VAS scores, suggesting the improvement of taste perception. Moreover, PPI therapy significantly decreased recognition thresholds for bitter taste in the anterior tongue (chorda tympani nerve area) and the thresholds in the posterior tongue (glossopharyngeal nerve area) for salty, sour, and bitter tastes. By contrast, H2-blocker therapy caused no significant changes of thresholds in the anterior tongue, but improved the threshold only for bitter in the posterior tongue, the value of which was however significantly higher than that in PPI group. In conclusion, PPI could ameliorate hypogeusia by improving bitter, salty, and sour tastes among patients with LPR.",

Methods: A pilot randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blind trial was conducted at an outpatient, single-center academic setting. Participants included 44 adults with serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment-refractory OCD and they received a stable fluvoxamine pharmacotherapy with Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores higher than 20. The 44 patients were randomly assigned into a study group and a control group, with 22 patiencs in each group. Fluvoxamine and MPH-ER were given to the study group, while fluvoxamine and placebo were given to the control group, with 8 weeks of the treatment course. Y-BOCS, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) were used to assess the efficacy, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to evaluate the sleep quality, and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) was used to evaluate the side effects. Data were analyzed in the intention-to-treat sample. Results: The improvement in the Y-BOCS total score, Y-BOCS obsession subscale score and HAMA score were more prominent in the study group than those in the control group (P<0.001). There was no significant difference in PSQI score and TESS score between the two groups. MPH-ER was well tolerated. Conclusion: Fluvoxamine combined with MPH-ER is effective in the treatment of refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder. It can improve anxiety and has no adverse effect on sleep quality.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To develop an intervention protocol for children's unintentional injury risk behaviors, and to evaluate the feasibility of the protocol. Methods: By theoretically analyzing the influential factors for children's unintentional injury risk behaviors, children's cognitive development characteristics and the social learning theory, an intervention protocol was established on the basis of changing the unintentional injury attribution and negative information transmission of risk behavior consequences. A primary school in Changsha city was selected by random cluster sampling. A community-based randomized controlled trial was conducted on the selected students once a week for 5 consecutive weeks. The scores of unintentional injury risk behavior before intervention, 3 months and 6 months after intervention, and the frequency before intervention and 6 months after intervention, were collected and compared. Results: A total of 194 children were included in the study: 98 in the intervention group; 96 in the control group; 96 (49.5%) boys and 98 (50.5%) girls between 7 and 8 years old. The scores of unintentional injury risk behavior for children in the intervention group at 3 and 6 months after intervention were 14.42+/-5.67 and 14.14+/-8.95, respectively, lower than those before the intervention (16.85+/-8.48) and in the control group (P=0.001). The number of minor unintentional injuries in the intervention group decreased from 119 to 56, and the number of children suffering 2 or more injuries dropped from 34 to 10 (P<0.001) at 6 months after the intervention, while both of them were lower than that in the control group (P=0.011). Similar changes were observed in some slight or more serious unintentional injuries (P=0.030). Conclusion: The protocol for changing the attribution to unintentional injury and negative information transmission for risk behavior consequences was proved to effectively reduce children's unintentional injury risk behaviors and relevant events.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Mothers in Motion (MIM), a community-based intervention program, was designed to help young, low-income women with overweight or obesity prevent further weight gain by promoting stress management, healthy eating, and physical activity. This paper presents the MIM's intervention effect on self-efficacy to cope with stress, emotional coping response, social support for stress management, stress, depressive symptoms, and positive and negative affect. METHODS: Participants (N = 612) were recruited from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children in Michigan. They were randomly assigned to an intervention group (410 participants) or comparison group (202 participants). During the 16-week intervention, intervention participants watched ten video lessons at home and joined ten peer support group teleconferences. Surveys with established validity and reliability were used to measure self-efficacy to cope with stress, emotional coping response, and social support for stress management. The Perceived Stress Scale, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and Positive and Negative Affect Scale were used to measure stress, depressive symptoms, and positive and negative affect, respectively. A general linear mixed model was applied to test the intervention effect at the end of the 16-week intervention (T2, n = 338) and at three-month follow-up (T3, n = 311). RESULTS: At T2, the intervention group reported significantly higher self-efficacy to cope with stress (effect size [Cohen's d] = 0.53), better emotional coping response (d = 0.38), less stress (d = 0.34), fewer depressive symptoms (d = - 0.27), and more positive affect (d = 0.31) than the comparison group. However, there were no significant differences in social support for stress management and negative affect between these two groups. At T3, the intervention group still reported significantly higher self-efficacy to cope with stress (d = 0.32) and better emotional coping response (d = 0.34) than the comparison group but did not report significantly higher social support for stress management, stress, depressive symptoms, and positive and negative affect. CONCLUSIONS: To help young, low-income women with overweight or obesity manage stress, researchers and program planners may consider focusing on building self-efficacy to cope with stress.

    "AB": "Background Knee pain is one of the common complaints patients present with in any community based health camps and Osteoarthritis of knee is a usual diagnosis. Injecting a long acting steroid is a common practice to alleviate the symptoms of osteoarthritic knee. Objective To evaluate the clinical outcome of injecting Triamcinolone acetenoid in osteoarthritis of knee in a community set up over a randomized double-blind placebo control trial. Method A prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo control trial was carried out in community after obtaining the ethical clearance from the IRC. Patients with clinically diagnosed osteoarthritis of knee were injected either Triamcinolone or Placebo after recording the baseline scores of the knee by Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) - Physical Function Short form (KOOS-PS), the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The same tools were used at two, six and at twelve weeks post injection to evaluate the functional outcome and pain. Result One hundred and seventeen patients were available for analysis among which, 55(48.7%) patients received Triamcinolone and 58(51.3%) received placebo. The baseline status of knees of two groups was comparable at the start of study. There was significant pain relief in the group receiving Triamcinolone at two and six week but not in twelve weeks. Group receiving placebo had pain relief only for first two weeks. Functional outcome was significantly improved compared to baseline in both the groups until six weeks however, in the triamcinolone group, it was significant until twelve weeks. No major complications were noted. Conclusion Intra-articular injection of Triamcinolone acetenoid is effective in symptoms control and improving functional outcome in clinically diagnosed osteoarthritis of knees in community set up during health camps.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Infections acquired in hospital are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in very preterm infants. Several small trials have suggested that supplementing the enteral diet of very preterm infants with lactoferrin, an antimicrobial protein processed from cow's milk, prevents infections and associated complications. The aim of this large randomised controlled trial was to collect data to enhance the validity and applicability of the evidence from previous trials to inform practice. METHODS: In this randomised placebo-controlled trial, we recruited very preterm infants born before 32 weeks' gestation in 37 UK hospitals and younger than 72 h at randomisation. Exclusion criteria were presence of a severe congenital anomaly, anticipated enteral fasting for longer than 14 days, or no realistic prospect of survival. Eligible infants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either enteral bovine lactoferrin (150 mg/kg per day; maximum 300 mg/day; lactoferrin group) or sucrose (same dose; control group) once daily until 34 weeks' postmenstrual age. Web-based randomisation minimised for recruitment site, gestation (completed weeks), sex, and single versus multifetal pregnancy. Parents, caregivers, and outcome assessors were unaware of group assignment. The primary outcome was microbiologically confirmed or clinically suspected late-onset infection (occurring >72 h after birth), which was assessed in all participants for whom primary outcome data was available by calculating the relative risk ratio with 95% CI between the two groups. The trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number 88261002. FINDINGS: We recruited 2203 participants between May 7, 2014, and Sept 28, 2017, of whom 1099 were assigned to the lactoferrin group and 1104 to the control group. Four infants had consent withdrawn or unconfirmed, leaving 1098 infants in the lactoferrin group and 1101 in the sucrose group. Primary outcome data for 2182 infants (1093 [99.5%] of 1098 in the lactoferrin group and 1089 [99.0] of 1101 in the control group) were available for inclusion in the modified intention-to-treat analyses. 316 (29%) of 1093 infants in the intervention group acquired a late-onset infection versus 334 (31%) of 1089 in the control group. The risk ratio adjusted for minimisation factors was 0.95 (95% CI 0.86-1.04; p=0.233). During the trial there were 16 serious adverse events for infants in the lactoferrin group and 10 for infants in the control group. Two events in the lactoferrin group (one case of blood in stool and one death after intestinal perforation) were assessed as being possibly related to the trial intervention. INTERPRETATION: Enteral supplementation with bovine lactoferrin does not reduce the risk of late-onset infection in very preterm infants. These data do not support its routine use to prevent late-onset infection and associated morbidity or mortality in very preterm infants.

    "AB": "Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is considered a novel risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Several studies demonstrated that polyphenols are able to inhibit the growth of TMA-producing bacterial strains, and resveratrol (RSV) reduced TMAO levels in mice. In the present study, we evaluated the TMAO-reducing effect of a novel nutraceutical formulation containing grape pomace extract in humans (Taurisolo((R))). The Taurisolo((R)) polyphenol content was evaluated by a High Performance Liquid Chromatography-diode-array detector (HPLC-DAD) method, and RSV was monitored as an indicative marker. After in vitro GI digestion, intestinal bioaccessibility of RSV was 92.3%. A randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial was carried out to evaluate the TMAO-reducing effect of Taurisolo((R)). In acute, the maximum levels of RSV were detected both in serum and whole blood 60 min after the administration of Taurisolo((R)); in chronic, a significant increase of RSV was detected in serum after the 4-week treatment. After 4 weeks, the levels of TMAO were significantly decreased in the treatment group compared to placebo (63.6% vs. 0.54%, respectively, P < 0.0001). In conclusion, our data show that Taurisolo((R)) may represent a novel and useful natural remedy to reduce prognostic markers for incident cardiovascular events. Undoubtedly, further in vitro and in vivo studies need to be performed in order to elucidate possible mechanisms of action and corroborate our preliminary results.",

    "AB": "This study aimed to develop a multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention program targeted at children and adolescents with moderate to severe obesity, and assess the additional effects of exercise intervention when compared to usual care. Overall, the 103 enrolled participants were >/=85th percentile of age and sex-specific body mass index (BMI). Participants were divided into groups that received 16 weeks of either usual care or exercise intervention. The BMI z-score of the overall completers decreased by about 0.05 after the 16-week intervention (p = 0.02). After the intervention, only the exercise group had a significantly lower BMI z-score than the baseline score by about 0.1 (p = 0.03), but no significant group by time interaction effects were observed. At the 16-week follow-up, significant group by time interaction effects were observed in percentage body fat (%BF) (beta = -1.52, 95%CI = -2.58(-)-0.45), lean body mass (LM) (beta = 1.20, 95%CI = 0.12(-)2.29), diastolic blood pressure (beta = -5.24, 95%CI = -9.66(-)-0.83), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (beta = -1.67, 95%CI = -2.77(-)-1.01), and wall sit test score (beta = 50.74, 95%CI = 32.30(-)69.18). We developed a moderate-intensity intervention program that can be sustained in the real-world setting and is practically applicable to both moderate and severe obesity. After interventions, the exercise group had lower %BF and cardiometabolic risk markers, and higher LM and leg muscle strength compared to the usual care group.",

    "AB": "Poor nutritional status is common among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients including vitamin D (vitD(3)) deficiency. We conducted a double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to investigate if daily nutritional supplementation with vitD(3) (5000 IU) and phenylbutyrate (PBA, 2 x 500 mg) could mediate beneficial effects in treatment-naive HIV patients. Primary endpoint: the change in plasma HIV-1 comparing week 0 to 16 using modified intention-to-treat (mITT, n = 197) and per-protocol (n = 173) analyses. Secondary endpoints: longitudinal HIV viral load, T cell counts, body mass index (BMI), middle-upper-arm circumference (MUAC), and 25(OH)D(3) levels in plasma. Baseline characteristics were detectable viral loads (median 7897 copies/mL), low CD4(+) (median 410 cells/microL), and elevated CD8(+) (median 930 cells/microL) T cell counts. Most subjects were vitD(3) deficient at enrolment, but a gradual and significant improvement of vitD(3) status was demonstrated in the vitD(3) + PBA group compared with placebo (p < 0.0001) from week 0 to 16 (median 37.5 versus 115.5 nmol/L). No significant changes in HIV viral load, CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cell counts, BMI or MUAC could be detected. Clinical adverse events were similar in both groups. Daily vitD(3) + PBA for 16 weeks was well-tolerated and effectively improved vitD(3) status but did not reduce viral load, restore peripheral T cell counts or improve BMI or MUAC in HIV patients with slow progressive disease.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Belatacept (Nulojix; Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY) is a biological immunosuppressive drug used for the prophylaxis of acute rejection after renal transplantation. Few studies have described belatacept pharmacokinetics, and the effect of therapeutic drug monitoring has not been investigated. We have developed a drug-capture assay (using drug target) to measure belatacept in serum and applied this assay in a pharmacokinetic study in renal transplant recipients. METHODS: CD80 was used to trap belatacept onto streptavidin-coated wells. Captured drug was quantified using Eu-labeled protein A and time-resolved fluorescence. The assay was applied in a pilot pharmacokinetic study in renal transplanted patients receiving belatacept infusions. Belatacept serum concentrations were determined at several time points between belatacept infusions. A simple population pharmacokinetic model was developed to visualize measured and predicted belatacept serum concentrations. RESULTS: The assay range was 0.9-30 mg/L with accuracy within 91%-99% and coefficients of variation ranging from 1.2% to 3.6%. Predilution extended the measurement range to 130 mg/L with an accuracy of 90% and coefficients of variation of 3.8%. Samples were stable during storage at 4 degrees C for 15 days and during 2 freeze-thaw cycles. Belatacept concentrations were determined in a total of 203 serum samples collected during 26 infusion intervals from 5 renal transplant recipients. The population pharmacokinetic model visualized both measured and predicted concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed an automated, accurate, and precise assay for the determination of belatacept serum concentrations. The assay was successfully applied in a pharmacokinetic study in renal transplant recipients receiving belatacept infusions.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) therapy for chronic urinary retention (CUR) following traumatic brain injury (TBI). METHODS: This 2-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) enrolled 86 eligible patients with CUR following TBI. All included patients were randomly allocated to a treatment group (n = 43) or a sham group (n = 43). The administration of NMES or sham NMES, as intervention, was performed for an 8-week period treatment, and 4-week period follow-up. In addition, all subjects were required to undergo indwelling urinary catheter throughout the study period. The primary outcome was assessed by the post-voiding residual urine volume (PV-VRU). The secondary outcomes were evaluated by the voided volume, maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), and quality of life, as assessed by Barthel Index (BI) scale. In addition, adverse events were also recorded during the study period. All primary and secondary outcomes were measured at baseline, at the end of 8-week treatment, and 4-week follow-up. RESULTS: At the end of 8-week treatment, the patients in the treatment group did not achieve better outcomes in PV-VRU (P = .66), voided volume (P = .59), Qmax (P = .53), and BI scores (P = .67), than patients in the control group. At the end of 4-week follow-up, there were also no significant differences regarding the PV-VRU (P = .42), voided volume (P = .71), Qmax (P = .24), and BI scores (P = .75) between 2 groups. No adverse events occurred in either group. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the findings of this study showed that NMES therapy may not benefit patients with CUR following TBI.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUD: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of trigger point injection (TPI) and eutectic mixture local anesthetics (EMLA) cream on the postoperative shoulder pain in patients undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy. METHODS: In this randomized, single-blinded, and controlled study, total 75 patients were randomly allocated to TPI group (n = 25), EMLA group (n = 25), and control group (n = 25). TPI group received TPIs with 2 mL of 0.2% ropivacaine, and EMLA group received an occlusive dressing with EMLA cream 2 g on both shoulders. Overall, abdominal, and shoulder pains were evaluated at rest and in motion on postoperative day 3. RESULTS: The incidence of shoulder pain was significantly reduced in EMLA group (56%) compared to control (88%) or TPI (88%) groups (P = .025 in both); the severity of shoulder pain was mitigated in EMLA and TPI groups compared to control group (P < .001, each). Consequently, the overall pain decreased in EMLA group and TPI group (P = .023). The patients with exercise habit (n = 31) showed lower incidence of pain than patients without exercise habit (n = 26) (P = .002, P = .005, and P = .037 in overall, abdominal, and shoulder pain, respectively). TPI or EMLA treatments decreased shoulder pain irrespective of exercise habit (P = .001 and P < .001, respectively), but decreased overall pain only in patients without exercise habit (P = .019). Lastly, EMLA lowered overall pain score at the time of first analgesic request in ward compared to control group (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: TPI and EMLA with occlusive dressing effectively reduced the shoulder pain after total laparoscopic hysterectomy.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effectiveness and safety of exercise training (ET) as an adjunctive therapy to montelukast for children with mild asthma (MA). METHODS: A total of 72 children, ages 4 to 12 years with MA were randomly assigned to a treatment group or a control group at a ratio of 1:1. The subjects in the treatment group received ET plus montelukast, while the participants in the control group received montelukast alone. The primary endpoint was lung function, as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and ratio between FEV1 and forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC). The secondary endpoints included the symptom improvements, as measured by clinical assessment score, and quality of life (QoL), as assessed with Paediatric Allergic Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PADQLQ) scores. In addition, adverse events were also assessed during the period of this study. All outcomes were measured at baseline, at the end of 6-week treatment and 2-week follow-up after the treatment. RESULTS: After 6-week treatment and 2-week follow-up, although ET plus montelukast did not show better effectiveness in improving lung function, as evaluated by the FEV1 (P > .05) and FEV1/FVC (P > .05) than montelukast alone, significant relief in clinical symptoms (P < .01), and improvement in QoL (P < .01) have achieved. Additionally, both groups had similar safety profile. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that ET as an adjunctive therapy to montelukast may benefit for children with MA. Further studies are still needed to warrant the results of this study.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: The assessment of pelvis reposition exercise efficacy in the treatment of pelvic floor muscles (PFM) asymmetry. The hypothesis was that PFM asymmetry may have a functional reason related to lumbopelvic complex misalignment. DESIGN: A parallel group trial with follow-up METHODS:: Thirty young women were divided into 2 groups: experimental (n = 15) and control (n = 15). In experimental group one, a 15-minute trial of pelvis reposition exercise was carried out. Ober test, the Thomas test, and transabdominal PFM ultrasound measurements were performed in both groups. RESULTS: In the experimental group both the Ober and Thomas tests were positive at baseline in most subjects. After the exercise, improvement was noted in Ober test (P = .005; d = 0.75 on the right side, P = .005; d = 0.78 on the left side) and in the Thomas test (P = .005; d = 0.66 on the right side, P = .005; d = 0.67 on the left side). At baseline, the ultrasonographic evaluation of PFM performed during resting and during voluntary pelvic muscles contraction showed the right-left length asymmetry. The return of symmetrical PFM work after pelvis reposition exercise was observed in the experimental group. There were no statistically significant changes in the control group.s CONCLUSIONS:: We suggest that after reposition exercises, the pelvis was more symmetrically aligned in relation to body axis; therefore, the muscles of the pelvic floor have functional length and did not shorten or lengthen due to pelvis rotation. In this study, for the first time, it was presented that PFM asymmetry visible in ultrasonography may be corrected by this specific exercise. Further analysis of the causes of this asymmetry may lead to more accurate treatment of PFM dysfunctions.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Residual postoperative neuromuscular blockade is an important clinical issue. Neuromuscular monitoring is usually used to evaluate neuromuscular recovery in patients undergoing general anesthesia. However, this procedure is inconvenient and not widely adopted. We aimed to examine the correlation between grip strength and train-of-four ratio (TOFr) to examine whether assessing grip strength can be used clinically to monitor residual neuromuscular blockade. METHODS: One hundred twenty patients with ASA I or II scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia were enrolled in this study. All patients were randomly selected to receive standard anesthesia induction with either 0.6 mg.kg rocuronium or 0.2 mg.kg cisatracurium. Grip strength was tested in all patients using an electronic device before anesthesia and when TOFr values of 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9, and an hour later of TOFr value of 0.25. The time required for a change in TOFr values from 0.25 to 0.75 and 0.9 was evaluated. Spearman rank correlation analysis was performed to determine correlations between grip strength and TOFr. RESULTS: Spearman rank correlation analysis indicated that there was a significant correlation between grip strength and TOFr during patient recovery from general anesthesia (correlation coefficient for grip strength recovery [rs] = 0.886). Subgroup analysis revealed that there were no differences in mean maximum grip value recovery between patients treated with rocuronium and those treated with cisatracurium when TOFr was 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 or when the TOFr was 0.25 after 60 minutes (all P >.05). Recovery of TOFr from 0.25 to 0.75 and from 0.25 to 0.9 was longer in patients treated with rocuronium than in those treated with cisatracurium (both P <.001). CONCLUSION: There was a strong correlation between grip strength and TOFr during recovery from general anesthesia. Evaluation of grip strength can be used as an additional strategy to evaluate postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Alveolar osteitis is a frequent postoperative complication of third molar surgery. A number of preventive methods have been tried. Chlorhexidine is most widely used antiseptic which is thought to be helpful to prevent alveolar osteitis. The objective of this study was to evaluate role of 0.2% bio-adhesive chlorhexidine gel in reducing incidence of alveolar osteitis after surgical removal of mandibular third molars which causes extra monetary burden on the patients in the form of several follow up visits.. METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was performed in the Dental Section, Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad. Approval from ethical committee was obtained. Total 180 patients were randomly divided into Group A in which patients received 0.2% bio-adhesive chlorhexidine gel and Group B where patients received placebo gel in the extraction socket after removal of mandibular third molar. RESULTS: 0.2% bio-adhesive chlorhexidine gel used after mandibular third molar removal reduced incidence of alveolar osteitis by 10% in comparison to control group with statistically significant difference, i.e., p=0.044.. CONCLUSIONS: 2.3 times reduction in the incidence of alveolar osteitis was observed after use of 0.2% bio-adhesive chlorhexidine gel.",

Hydrocephalus is a common condition associated with myelomeningocele. Hydrocephalus is seen in 11.8% of children with Myelomeningocele (MMC). This study was conducted to compare the simultaneous vs delayed ventriculoperitoneal shunting in children undergoing myelomeningocele in terms of infection. METHODS: This Randomized Control Trial was conducted at department of Neurosurgery, Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad from 7th March to 7th June 2016. In this study a total of 98 patients with MMC and hydrocephalus were randomly divided into two equal groups. In group A simultaneous MMC repair and VP shunting was performed while in group B MMC repair was done in first and VP shunting was done two weeks postoperatively.. RESULTS: In this study mean age in Group A was 1 years with SD+/-2.77 while mean age in Group B was 1 years with SD+/-3.12. In Group A (12%) patients had infection and (88%) whereas in Group B (20%) patients had infection and (80%) patients didn't had infection..

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: We performed a prospective phase II study to compare acute toxicity among five different hypofractionated schedules using proton therapy. This study was an exploratory analysis to investigate the secondary end-point of biochemical failure-free survival (BCFFS) of patients with long-term follow-up. METHODS: Eighty-two patients with T1-3bN0M0 prostate cancer who had not received androgen-deprivation therapy were randomized to one of five arms: Arm 1, 60 cobalt gray equivalent (CGE)/20 fractions/5 weeks; Arm 2, 54 CGE/15 fractions/5 weeks; Arm 3, 47 CGE/10 fractions/5 weeks; Arm 4, 35 CGE/5 fractions/2.5 weeks; and Arm 5, 35 CGE/5 fractions/4 weeks. In the current exploratory analysis, these ardms were categorized into the moderate hypofractionated (MHF) group (52 patients in Arms 1-3) and the extreme hypofractionated (EHF) group (30 patients in Arms 4-5). RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 7.5 years (range, 1.3-9.6 years), 7-year BCFFS was 76.2% for the MHF group and 46.2% for the EHF group (p = 0.005). The 7-year BCFFS of the MHF and EHF groups were 90.5 and 57.1% in the low-risk group (p = 0.154); 83.5 and 42.9% in the intermediate risk group (p = 0.018); and 41.7 and 40.0% in the high risk group (p = 0.786), respectively. Biochemical failure tended to be a late event with a median time to occurrence of 5 years. Acute GU toxicities were more common in the MHF than the EHF group (85 vs. 57%, p = 0.009), but late GI and GU toxicities did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the efficacy of EHF is potentially inferior to that of MHF and that further studies are warranted, therefore, to confirm these findings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, no. NCT01709253 ; registered October 18, 2012; retrospectively registered).",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Mental health disorders among adolescents have emerged as a major public health issue in many low and middle-income countries, including India. There is a paucity of research on the determinants of psychological distress, particularly among the poorest girls in the poorest communities. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and correlates of different indicators of psychological distress among 13-14 year old low caste girls in rural, south India. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 1191 low caste girls in two districts in north Karnataka, conducted as part of a cluster randomised-control trial. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis assessed correlates of different indicators of psychological distress. RESULTS: More than one third of girls (35.1%) reported having no hope for the future. 6.9% reported feeling down, depressed or hopeless in the past 2 weeks. 2.1% reported thinking they would be better off dead or of hurting themselves in some way in the past 2 weeks. 1.6% reported sexual abuse, 8.0% rrecent eve teasing and 6.3% having no parental emotional support. Suicidal ideation was independently associated with sexual abuse (AOR 11.9 (3.0-47.0)) and a lack of parental emotional support (AOR 0.2 (0.1-0.5)). Feeling down, depressed or hopeless was independently associated with recent eve-teasing (AOR 2.9 (1.6-5.4)), a harassing or abusive school environment (AOR 3.9 (1.8-8.2)), being frequently absent (AOR 2.8 (1.5-5.5)) or having dropped out of school (AOR 2.1 (1.0-4.3)), and living in Vijayapura district (AOR 2.5 (1.6-4.1)). Having no hope for the future was independently associated with a range of factors, including recent \"eve-teasing\" (AOR 1.5 (1.0-2.4)), being engaged (AOR 2.9 (0.9-9.7)), not participating in groups (AOR 0.5 (0.4-0.6)) and a lack of emotional support (AOR 0.6 (0.4-0.7)). CONCLUSIONS: Rather than being a time of optimism, a third of low caste girls in rural north, Karnataka have limited hope for the future, with some contemplating suicide. As well as having important development benefits, interventions that address the upstream structural and gender-norms based determinants of poor mental health, and provide adolescent services for girls who require treatment and support, should have important benefits for girls' psychological wellbeing.

    "AB": "AIMS OF THE STUDY: The safety and efficacy of a hemostatic powder (HP) versus a control agent, absorbable gelatin sponge and thrombin (G + T), were assessed, using a validated, quantitative bleeding severity scale. METHODS: Subjects were randomized to receive HP (256 subjects) or G + T (132 subjects) for treatment of minimal, mild, or moderate bleeding at 20 investigational sites. The primary efficacy endpoint was non-inferiority of HP relative to G + T for success at achieving hemostasis within 6 minutes. Secondary endpoints in rank order included: superiority of HP relative to G + T in mean preparation time; non-inferiority of HP relative to G + T for achieving hemostasis within 3 min; superiority of HP relative to G + T for achieving hemostasis within 6 min; and superiority of HP relative to G + T for success for achieving hemostasis within 3 min. RESULTS: A total of 388 subjects were included in the primary efficacy analysis. At 6 min, hemostasis was achieved in 93.0% (238/256) of the HP group compared to 77.3% (102/132) of the G + T group (non-inferiority P < 0.0001, superiority P < 0.0001). All secondary endpoints were met. Complications were comparable between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: HP had superior rates of hemostasis, shorter preparation time, and a similar safety profile compared to G + T in this prospective, randomized trial using quantitative bleeding severity criteria.",

METHODS: In this prospective, controlled study, 60 age-related cataract patients with mild Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) were randomized to treatment with an ocular bandage contact lens (BCL) (n = 30) or to an untreated control group (n = 30) after phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation. The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire, evaluation of subjective symptoms and evaluation of the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were conducted preoperatively and postoperatively on days 1, 7, 14, 30 and 90. The tear breakup time (TBUT), Schirmer test with anesthesia, and fluorescein staining scores were measured preoperatively and postoperatively on days 7, 14, 30 and 90. RESULTS: There were no significant differences with respect to the BCVA between the groups at any time point. For the comparison of the OSDI, subjective evaluation scores, TBUT and fluorescein staining, statistically significant improvements were noted in the BCL group, especially on days 7 and 14 (P < 0.001, P < 0.001; P = 0.031, P = 0.009; P = 0.021, P = 0.028; and P = 0.03, P = 0.032, respectively). The Schirmer test results did not significantly change postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: A BCL can improve tear film stability and lessen dry eye discomfort immediately after phacoemulsification.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: In acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), an immune-mediated deficiency of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS13 allows unrestrained adhesion of von Willebrand factor multimers to platelets and microthrombosis, which result in thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and tissue ischemia. Caplacizumab, an anti-von Willebrand factor humanized, bivalent variable-domain-only immunoglobulin fragment, inhibits interaction between von Willebrand factor multimers and platelets. METHODS: In this double-blind, controlled trial, we randomly assigned 145 patients with TTP to receive caplacizumab (10-mg intravenous loading bolus, followed by 10 mg daily subcutaneously) or placebo during plasma exchange and for 30 days thereafter. The primary outcome was the time to normalization of the platelet count, with discontinuation of daily plasma exchange within 5 days thereafter. Key secondary outcomes included a composite of TTP-related death, recurrence of TTP, or a thromboembolic event during the trial treatment period; recurrence of TTP at any time during the trial; refractory TTP; and normalization of organ-damage markers. RESULTS: The median time to normalization of the platelet count was shorter with caplacizumab than with placebo (2.69 days [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.89 to 2.83] vs. 2.88 days [95% CI, 2.68 to 3.56], P=0.01), and patients who received caplacizumab were 1.55 times as likely to have a normalization of the platelet count as those who received placebo. The percentage of patients with a composite outcome event was 74% lower with caplacizumab than with placebo (12% vs. 49%, P<0.001). The percentage of patients who had a recurrence of TTP at any time during the trial was 67% lower with caplacizumab than with placebo (12% vs. 38%, P<0.001). Refractory disease developed in no patients in the caplacizumab group and in three patients in the placebo group. Patients who received caplacizumab needed less plasma exchange and had a shorter hospitalization than those who received placebo. The most common adverse event was mucocutaneous bleeding, which was reported in 65% of the patients in the caplacizumab group and in 48% in the placebo group. During the trial treatment period, three patients in the placebo group died. One patient in the caplacizumab group died from cerebral ischemia after the end of the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with TTP, treatment with caplacizumab was associated with faster normalization of the platelet count; a lower incidence of a composite of TTP-related death, recurrence of TTP, or a thromboembolic event during the treatment period; and a lower rate of recurrence of TTP during the trial than placebo.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative complications, especially pulmonary complications, affect more than half the patients who undergo open esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Whether hybrid minimally invasive esophagectomy results in lower morbidity than open esophagectomy is unclear. METHODS: We performed a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial involving patients 18 to 75 years of age with resectable cancer of the middle or lower third of the esophagus. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo transthoracic open esophagectomy (open procedure) or hybrid minimally invasive esophagectomy (hybrid procedure). Surgical quality assurance was implemented by the credentialing of surgeons, standardization of technique, and monitoring of performance. Hybrid surgery comprised a two-field abdominal-thoracic operation (also called an Ivor-Lewis procedure) with laparoscopic gastric mobilization and open right thoracotomy. The primary end point was intraoperative or postoperative complication of grade II or higher according to the Clavien-Dindo classification (indicating major complication leading to intervention) within 30 days. Analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: From October 2009 through April 2012, we randomly assigned 103 patients to the hybrid-procedure group and 104 to the open-procedure group. A total of 312 serious adverse events were recorded in 110 patients. A total of 37 patients (36%) in the hybrid-procedure group had a major intraoperative or postoperative complication, as compared with 67 (64%) in the open-procedure group (odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18 to 0.55; P<0.001). A total of 18 of 102 patients (18%) in the hybrid-procedure group had a major pulmonary complication, as compared with 31 of 103 (30%) in the open-procedure group. At 3 years, overall survival was 67% (95% CI, 57 to 75) in the hybrid-procedure group, as compared with 55% (95% CI, 45 to 64) in the open-procedure group; disease-free survival was 57% (95% CI, 47 to 66) and 48% (95% CI, 38 to 57), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We found that hybrid minimally invasive esophagectomy resulted in a lower incidence of intraoperative and postoperative major complications, specifically pulmonary complications, than open esophagectomy, without compromising overall and disease-free survival over a period of 3 years.

    "AB": "PURPOSE: While some micro-organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus, are clearly implicated in causing tissue damage in diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), our knowledge of the contribution of the entire microbiome to clinical outcomes is limited. We profiled the microbiome of a longitudinal sample series of 28 people with diabetes and DFUs of the heel in an attempt to better characterize the relationship between healing, infection and the microbiome. METHODOLOGY: In total, 237 samples were analysed from 28 DFUs, collected at fortnightly intervals for 6 months or until healing. Microbiome profiles were generated by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, supplemented by targeted nanopore sequencing.Result/Key findings. DFUs which failed to heal during the study period (20/28, 71.4 %) were more likely to be persistently colonized with a heterogeneous community of micro-organisms including anaerobes and Enterobacteriaceae (log-likelihood ratio 9.56, P=0.008). During clinically apparent infection, a reduction in the diversity of micro-organisms in a DFU was often observed due to expansion of one or two taxa, with recovery in diversity at resolution. Modelling of the predicted species interactions in a single DFU with high diversity indicated that networks of metabolic interactions may exist that contribute to the formation of stable communities. CONCLUSION: Longitudinal profiling is an essential tool for improving our understanding of the microbiology of chronic wounds, as community dynamics associated with clinical events can only be identified by examining changes over multiple time points. The development of complex communities, particularly involving Enterobacteriaceae and strict anaerobes, may be contributing to poor outcomes in DFUs and requires further investigation.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Incidence of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) for Indigenous Australians is especially high in remote and very remote areas of Australia (18 and 20 times the rate of comparable non-Indigenous people). Relocating away from family and country for treatment, adjusting to life with a chronic condition and time lost to dialysis cause grief and sadness which have immense impact on quality of life and challenges treatment adherence. We describe the first randomised controlled trial to address both chronic disease and mental health in Indigenous people with ESKD, which is the first to test the effectiveness of a culturally adapted e-mental health intervention in this population. It builds on an existing program of mental health research with demonstrated efficacy - the Aboriginal and Islander Mental Health Initiative (AIMhi) - to test the newly developed electronic motivational care planning (MCP) therapy - the AIMhi Stay Strong App. METHODS: This is a 3-arm, waitlist, single-blind randomised controlled trial testing the efficacy of the Stay Strong App in improving psychological distress, depressive symptoms, quality of life and treatment adherence among Indigenous clients undergoing haemodialysis for ESKD in Alice Springs and Darwin with follow up over two periods of 3 months (total of 6 months observation). The study compares the efficacy of MCP using the AIMhi Stay Strong App with two control groups (control app intervention and treatment as usual) on participant-reported psychological distress (the primary outcome) using the Kessler Distress Scale (K10); depressive symptoms using the adapted Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9); quality of life using the EuroQoL instrument (EQ5D) and adherence to dialysis treatment planning through file audit. Participants are randomised to receive MCP either at baseline (early treatment) or after 3 months (delayed treatment). The study also examines the cost effectiveness of this therapy in this setting through examination of health care service utilisation across groups during the first 3 months. DISCUSSION: This project will contribute much needed evidence on the efficacy of an electronic wellbeing intervention for Indigenous people with ESKD - a group in which distress is likely to be unacceptably high, yet relatively untreated.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Nutrition cares are of the main measures to save premature infants. In this regard, proper positioning is one of the key measures that is done by nurses; still there is a paucity of studies in this field and the results of these few studies are an area of ongoing debates. In light of this, the present paper is an attempt to determine the effects of different positioning on gastric residual volume in premature infants in NICU. METHODS: A clinical trial cross-over study was carried out on premature infants in NICU. The subjects, who had inclusion criteria, were selected through convenience sampling based on inclusion criteria and randomly allocated into three groups. Gastric residual volume before and one hours after feeding was measured and recorded for three positions including right-lateral, left-lateral, and prone. The data was analyzed via SPSS-21 using descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency; and inferential statistics such as Chi Squared, Kruskal Wallis test, and Friedman test. RESULTS: Totally, 135 infants in three groups were studied and the results showed that minimum and maximum gastric residual volumes were in prone (6.49 +/- 8.25 ML) and supine (12.59 +/- 11.9 ML) positions, respectively. However, Kruskal Wallis test did not show a significant relationship between the three positions under study and the mean gastric residual volume. CONCLUSION: Prone position was featured with the lowest gastric residual volume and highest possibility of absorbing nutrient. Still, given the fact that no significant difference was found in the three groups, further and deeper studies are needed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The project is approved by Iranian Registry of Clinical Trial with no. IRCT. 201404134736 N6 .",

    "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Joint hypermobility is common in childhood and can be associated with musculoskeletal pain and dysfunction. Current management is delivered by a multidisciplinary team, but evidence of effectiveness is limited. This clinical trial aimed to determine whether a structured multidisciplinary, multisite intervention resulted in improved clinical outcomes compared with standard care. METHOD: A prospective randomised, single centre parallel group trial comparing an 8-week individualised multidisciplinary intervention programme (bespoke physiotherapy and occupational therapy in the clinical, home and school environment) with current standard management (advice, information and therapy referral if deemed necessary). The primary endpoint of the study was between group difference in child reported pain from baseline to 12 months as assessed using the Wong Baker faces pain scale. Secondary endpoints were parent reported pain (100 mm visual analogue scale), parent reported function (child health assessment questionnaire), child reported quality of life (child health utility 9-dimensional assessment), coordination (movement assessment battery for children version 2) and grip strength (handheld dynamometer). RESULTS: 119 children aged 5 to 16 years, with symptomatic hypermobility were randomised to receive an individualised multidisciplinary intervention (I) (n = 59) or standard management (S) (n = 60). Of these, 105 completed follow up at 12 months. No additional significant benefit could be shown from the intervention compared to standard management. However, there was a statistically significant improvement in child and parent reported pain, coordination and grip strength in both groups. The response was independent of the degree of hypermobility. CONCLUSION: This is the first randomised controlled trial to compare a structured multidisciplinary, multisite intervention with standard care in symptomatic childhood hypermobility. For the majority, the provision of education and positive interventions aimed at promoting healthy exercise and self-management was associated with significant benefit without the need for more complex interventions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered prospectively with the national database at the Clinical Research Network (UKCRN Portfolio 9366). The trial was registered retrospectively with ISRCTN ( ISRCTN86573140 ).",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: The burden of chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is increasing in women, with recent evidence suggesting gender differences in disease characteristics and potentially in treatment outcomes. METHODS: FLAME was a 52-week randomized controlled trial in patients with severe-to-very-severe COPD and a history of exacerbations. In this post-hoc analysis, gender-based baseline differences and treatment outcomes between indacaterol/glycopyrronium 110/50 mug once daily (IND/GLY) and salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 twice daily (SFC) were assessed in terms of rate of exacerbations, time-to-first exacerbation, lung function, health status, and rescue medication use. RESULTS: This post-hoc analysis included 2557 men and 805 women. Baseline characteristics differed between genders, with women being younger, having better lung function and more often experiencing >/=2 exacerbations in the previous year. Compared with SFC, IND/GLY treatment was associated with reductions in the annualized rates of moderate/severe exacerbations (rate ratio [95% CI]: 0.81 [0.73-0.91], 0.89 [0.74-1.07] in men and women, respectively). Similarly, time-to-first moderate/severe exacerbation was also delayed (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.79 [0.70-0.89] and 0.76 [0.63-0.91] in men and women, respectively). Results were similar for all (mild/moderate/severe) exacerbations. Improvements in lung function, health status and rescue medication use with IND/GLY vs SFC were comparable between men and women. The smaller sample size for women may account for some observed discrepancies in treatment responses. CONCLUSIONS: Although there were gender differences in baseline characteristics, IND/GLY demonstrated similar trends for exacerbation prevention and lung function improvement in men and women with moderate-to-very-severe COPD and a history of exacerbations compared with SFC. Small differences in the effects seen between genders may be attributed to the different sizes of the two groups and need to be further evaluated in randomized trials that are appropriately powered for gender analysis.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Pregnancy has been identified as a contributor to obesity. We have shown that a diet intervention postpartum produced a 2-y weight loss of 8%. Here, we present the impact of the diet intervention on cost-effectiveness and explore changes in quality of life (QOL). METHODS: A total of 110 postpartum women with overweight/obesity were randomly assigned to diet (D-group) or control (C-group). D-group received a 12-wk diet intervention within primary health care followed by monthly emails up to the 1-y follow-up. C-group received a brochure. Changes in QOL were measured using the 36-item Short Form Health Survey and EQ-5D. The analysis of cost-effectiveness was a cost-utility analysis with a health care perspective and included costs of intervention for stakeholder, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and savings in health care. The likelihood of cost-effectiveness was examined using the net monetary benefit method. RESULTS: The D-group increased their QOL more than the C-group at 12 wk. and 1 y, with pronounced differences for the dimensions general health and mental health, and the mental component summary score (all p < 0.05). Cost per gained QALY was 1704-7889 USD. The likelihood for cost-effectiveness, based on a willingness to pay 50,000 USD per QALY, was 0.77-1.00. CONCLUSIONS: A diet intervention that produced clinically relevant postpartum weight loss also resulted in increased QOL and was cost-effective.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: To identify baseline patient characteristics associated with early clinically significant visual acuity (VA) improvements within 3 months of treatment initiation in ranibizumab-treated patients with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) in the SHORE study. METHODS: Post hoc analysis of baseline patient characteristics in the randomized, open-label, vision examiner-masked SHORE phase 4 study that compared monthly versus pro re nata dosing of ranibizumab in patients with branch and central RVO. Patients who enrolled in SHORE fulfilled eligibility criteria per protocol (N = 202). SHORE data were retrospectively analyzed to identify baseline patient characteristics associated with early clinically significant improvements in VA, defined as improvement to a Snellen equivalent of 20/40 or better vision (>/= 69 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] letters) or an increase in best-corrected VA (BCVA) of 15 or more ETDRS letters from baseline within 3 months of treatment initiation. Main outcome measures were BCVA gain of 15 or more ETDRS letters from baseline, Snellen equivalent of 20/40 or better vision, and baseline factors associated with early clinically significant improvement in BCVA. RESULTS: The median time for patients to achieve a BCVA of 20/40 or better was 59 days and the median time for patients to gain 15 or more ETDRS letters was 63 days. Better baseline BCVA (> 50 ETDRS letters/Snellen equivalent >/= 20/100), greater baseline total macular volume (> 9.99 mm(3)), and presence of subretinal fluid at baseline were all associated with early improvement to 20/40 or better vision (ETDRS equivalent >/= 69 letters; P < .0001, P = .02, and P = .03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis found that better BCVA, greater total macular volume, and presence of subretinal fluid at baseline were associated with more rapid vision gains. Clinicians may find these helpful when considering the likelihood of achieving early clinically significant VA improvements with ranibizumab in patients with RVO.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate how high-dose ecabet sodium affects low-dose aspirin-induced small intestinal mucosal injury in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Healthy volunteers were enrolled randomly into one of two groups with the following drug regimens for 2 weeks: group A, low-dose aspirin once per day and group B, low-dose aspirin and 4.0 g of ecabet sodium. Small bowel capsule endoscopy was performed before and 2 weeks after low-dose aspirin administration. RESULTS: A significant difference was found in the median number [range] of small intestinal lesions between baseline and two weeks after low-dose aspirin administration in group A (baseline: 1 [0-5], after: 5 [1-11]; p = 0.0059) but not in group B (baseline: 0.5 [0-9], after: 3 [0-23]; p = 0.0586). In group B, although the median number [range] of lesions in the first tertile of the small intestine did not increase two weeks after low-dose aspirin administration (baseline: 0 [0-4], after: 1.5 [0-8]; p = 0.2969), the number of lesions in the second and third tertiles of the small intestine increased significantly (baseline: 0 [0-5], after: 2 [0-15]; p = 0.0469). CONCLUSIONS: Ecabet sodium had a preventive effect on low-dose aspirin-induced small intestinal mucosal injury in the upper part of the small intestine.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Single acute infarction (SAI) usually had lower risk of stroke recurrence than multiple acute infarctions (MAIs) in minor stroke. To evaluate whether all SAI had lower risk of stroke recurrence than MAIs in minor stroke. METHODS: We derived data from the imaging subgroup of the Clopidogrel in High-risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial. Minor stroke were categorized into SAI and MAIs by infarction numbers in diffusion weighted imaging. SAI were classified as lacunar infarction and non-lacunar infarction. The outcome was stroke recurrence within one-year follow-up. We assessed the associations between infarction patterns and stroke recurrence using multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: Overall, 834 patients with minor stroke were included in this subgroup, 553 SAI (381 lacunar infarction, 172 non-lacunar infarction) and 281 MAIs. The rate of stroke recurrence was 7.6%, 15.1% and 15.3% in lacunar infarction of SAI, non-lacunar infarction of SAI and MAIs at one year, respectively. Compared with MAIs, lacunar infarction of SAI had lower risk of stroke recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 0.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21-0.80, P = 0.009), but not in non-lacunar infarction of SAI (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.60-1.69, P = 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Lacunar infarction of SAI have lower risk of stroke recurrence than MAIs, while non-lacunar infarction of SAI might have similar risk as MAIs. Except for the number of infarctions, size and location should also be considered to stratify risk of stroke recurrence in minor stroke.

    "AB": "Phytonutrients and vitamin and mineral supplementation have been reported to provide increased antioxidant capacity in humans; however, there is still controversy. In the current clinical trial, we examined the antioxidant and DNA protection capacity of a plant-based, multi-vitamin/mineral, and phytonutrient (PMP) supplementation in healthy adults who were habitually low in the consumption of fruits and vegetables. This study was an eight-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel-arm, and placebo-controlled trial. PMP supplementation for eight weeks reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and prevented DNA damage without altering endogenous antioxidant system. Plasma vitamins and phytonutrients were significantly correlated with ROS scavenging and DNA damage. In addition, gene expression analysis in PBMC showed subtle changes in superoxide metabolic processes. In this study, we showed that supplementation with a PMP significantly improved ROS scavenging activity and prevented DNA damage. However, additional research is still needed to further identify mechanisms of actions and the role of circulating phytonutrient metabolites.",

    "AB": "Whey protein is rich in the branched-chain amino acids, L-leucine, L-isoleucine and L-valine. Thus, branched-chain amino acids may, at least in part, mediate the effects of whey to reduce energy intake and/or blood glucose. Notably, 10 g of either L-leucine or L-isoleucine, administered intragastrically before a mixed-nutrient drink, lowered postprandial blood glucose, and intraduodenal infusion of L-leucine (at a rate of 0.45 kcal/min, total: 9.9 g) lowered fasting blood glucose and reduced energy intake from a subsequent meal. Whether L-valine affects energy intake, and the gastrointestinal functions involved in the regulation of energy intake, as well as blood glucose, in humans, is currently unknown. We investigated the effects of intraduodenally administered L-valine on antropyloroduodenal pressures, plasma cholecystokinin, blood glucose and energy intake. Twelve healthy lean men (age: 29 +/- 2 years, BMI: 22.5 +/- 0.7 kg/m(2)) were studied on 3 separate occasions in randomised, double-blind order. Antropyloroduodenal pressures, plasma cholecystokinin, blood glucose, appetite perceptions and gastrointestinal symptoms were measured during 90-min intraduodenal infusions of L-valine at 0.15 kcal/min (total: 3.3 g) or 0.45 kcal/min (total: 9.9 g), or 0.9% saline (control). Energy intake from a buffet-meal immediately after the infusions was quantified. L-valine did not affect antral, pyloric (mean number; control: 14 +/- 5; L-Val-0.15: 21 +/- 9; L-Val-0.45: 11 +/- 4), or duodenal pressures, plasma cholecystokinin (mean concentration, pmol/L; control: 3.1 +/- 0.3; L-Val-0.15: 3.2 +/- 0.3; L-Val-0.45: 3.0 +/- 0.3), blood glucose, appetite perceptions, symptoms or energy intake (kcal; control: 1040 +/- 73; L-Val-0.15: 1040 +/- 81; L-Val-0.45: 1056 +/- 100), at either load (p > 0.05 for all). In conclusion, intraduodenal infusion of L-valine, at loads that are moderately (3.3 g) or substantially (9.9 g) above World Health Organization valine requirement recommendations, does not appear to have energy intake- or blood glucose-lowering effects.",

    "AB": "Importance: Microvascular obstruction commonly affects patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and is associated with adverse outcomes. Objective: To determine whether a therapeutic strategy involving low-dose intracoronary fibrinolytic therapy with alteplase infused early after coronary reperfusion will reduce microvascular obstruction. Design, Setting, and Participants: Between March 17, 2016, and December 21, 2017, 440 patients presenting at 11 hospitals in the United Kingdom within 6 hours of STEMI due to a proximal-mid-vessel occlusion of a major coronary artery were randomized in a 1:1:1 dose-ranging trial design. Patient follow-up to 3 months was completed on April 12, 2018. Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned to treatment with placebo (n = 151), alteplase 10 mg (n = 144), or alteplase 20 mg (n = 145) by manual infusion over 5 to 10 minutes. The intervention was scheduled to occur early during the primary PCI procedure, after reperfusion of the infarct-related coronary artery and before stent implant. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the amount of microvascular obstruction (% left ventricular mass) demonstrated by contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) conducted from days 2 through 7 after enrollment. The primary comparison was the alteplase 20-mg group vs the placebo group; if not significant, the alteplase 10-mg group vs the placebo group was considered a secondary analysis. Results: Recruitment stopped on December 21, 2017, because conditional power for the primary outcome based on a prespecified analysis of the first 267 randomized participants was less than 30% in both treatment groups (futility criterion). Among the 440 patients randomized (mean age, 60.5 years; 15% women), the primary end point was achieved in 396 patients (90%), 17 (3.9%) withdrew, and all others were followed up to 3 months. In the primary analysis, the mean microvascular obstruction did not differ between the 20-mg alteplase and placebo groups (3.5% vs 2.3%; estimated difference, 1.16%; 95% CI, -0.08% to 2.41%; P = .32) nor in the analysis of 10-mg alteplase vs placebo groups (2.6% vs 2.3%; estimated difference, 0.29%; 95% CI, -0.76% to 1.35%; P = .74). Major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, nonfatal MI, unplanned hospitalization for heart failure) occurred in 15 patients (10.1%) in the placebo group, 18 (12.9%) in the 10-mg alteplase group, and 12 (8.2%) in the 20-mg alteplase group. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with acute STEMI presenting within 6 hours of symptoms, adjunctive low-dose intracoronary alteplase given during the primary percutaneous intervention did not reduce microvascular obstruction. The study findings do not support this treatment. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02257294.",

    "AB": "Importance: Despite guideline recommendations, many patients discontinue P2Y12 inhibitor therapy earlier than the recommended 1 year after myocardial infarction (MI), and higher-potency P2Y12 inhibitors are underutilized. Cost is frequently cited as an explanation for both of these observations. Objective: To determine whether removing co-payment barriers increases P2Y12 inhibitor persistence and lowers risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Design, Setting, and Participants: Cluster randomized clinical trial among 301 hospitals enrolling adult patients with acute MI (June 5, 2015, through September 30, 2016); patients were followed up for 1 year after discharge (final date of follow-up was October 23, 2017), with blinded adjudication of MACE; choice of P2Y12 inhibitor was per clinician discretion. Interventions: Hospitals randomized to the intervention (n = 131 [6436 patients]) provided patients with co-payment vouchers for clopidogrel or ticagrelor for 1 year (median voucher value for a 30-day supply, $137 [25th-75th percentile, $20-$339]). Hospitals randomized to usual care (n = 156 [4565 patients]) did not provide study vouchers. Main Outcomes and Measures: Independent coprimary outcomes were patient-reported persistence with P2Y12 inhibitor (defined as continued treatment without gap in use >/=30 days) and MACE (death, recurrent MI, or stroke) at 1 year among patients discharged with a prescription for clopidogrel or ticagrelor. Results: Among 11001 enrolled patients (median age, 62 years; 3459 [31%] women), 10102 patients were discharged with prescriptions for clopidogrel or ticagrelor (clopidogrel prescribed to 2317 [36.0%] in the intervention group and 2497 [54.7%] in the usual care group), 4393 of 6135 patients (72%) in the intervention group used the voucher, and follow-up data at 1 year were available for 10802 patients (98.2%). Patient-reported persistence with P2Y12 inhibitors at 1 year was higher in the intervention group than in the control group (unadjusted rates, 5340/6135 [87.0%] vs 3324/3967 [83.8%], respectively; P < .001; adjusted difference, 2.3% [95% CI, 0.4% to 4.1%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.02 to 1.40]). There was no significant difference in MACE at 1 year between intervention and usual care groups (unadjusted cumulative incidence, 10.2% vs 10.6%; P = .65; adjusted difference, 0.66% [95% CI, -0.73% to 2.06%]; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.93 to 1.25]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with MI, provision of vouchers to offset medication co-payments for P2Y12 inhibitors, compared with no vouchers, resulted in a 3.3% absolute increase in patient-reported persistence with P2Y12 inhibitors and no significant reduction in 1-year MACE outcomes.

    "AB": "Background & objectives: : Three doses of intermittent preventive treatment with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) has been adopted as the new recommendation for prevention of malaria in pregnancy. This study evaluated the effectiveness of two-dose versus three-dose of SP for IPTp-SP in the prevention of low birth weight (LBW) and malaria parasitaemia. Methods: : An open, randomized, controlled, longitudinal trial was conducted in a secondary level hospital in Nsukka region of Enugu State, Nigeria. A sample of 210 pregnant women within gestational ages of 16-24 wk were recruited at antenatal clinics and equally randomized to either a two-dose SP or three-dose SP group. The primary endpoints were LBWs, peripheral, and placental parasitaemia, while the secondary endpoints were maternal anaemia, pre-term birth, clinical malaria and adverse effects of SP. Results: : Among 207 cases followed till delivery, the prevalence of parasitaemia was lower in three-dose group than in two-dose group for both peripheral (9.3% versus 27.8%) and placental (10.6% versus 25.6%) parasitaemia. The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were 0.15 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.05 - 0.45] and 0.17 (95% CI, 0.06-0.51), respectively. The prevalence of LBW was also lower in three-dose (3.5%) than in two-dose (12.2%) group (aOR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.04-0.63); however, the prevalence of maternal anaemia, pre-term births, clinical malaria and SP adverse effects were similar between the two arms of treatment. Interpretation & conclusion: : Addition of a third SP dose to the standard two-dose SP for IPTp led to improved reductions in the risk of some adverse pregnancy outcomes.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF) has demonstrated efficacy and a favorable benefit-risk profile in phase 2 and 3 studies that enrolled predominantly white patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). In this study (APEX, Part I), we evaluated the efficacy/safety outcomes of DMF in a predominantly East Asian population of patients with RRMS. METHODS: In this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study, 225 patients, 142 of which were East Asian (63.4%), were enrolled: Japan (n = 114), South Korea (n = 20), Taiwan (n = 8), the Czech Republic (n = 42), and Poland (n = 40). Key exclusion criteria included diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Stratified by country, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive DMF 240 mg twice daily or placebo. Clinical assessments, including neurological examination and EDSS scoring, were conducted at baseline and at weeks 12 and 24. RESULTS: A total of 213 patients (95.1%) completed the study. From weeks 12 - 24, the total number of new gadolinium-enhancing (Gd(+)) lesions was reduced by 84% (p < 0.0001) in DMF compared with placebo. For the secondary endpoint, from baseline to week 24, the total number of new Gd(+) lesions was reduced by 75% and the mean number of new/newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions was reduced by 63% (both p < 0.0001). Flushing and flushing-related symptoms, and gastrointestinal events were adverse events related to DMF treatment. Efficacy and safety results in the Japanese subgroup and the East Asian subgroup (which included patients from Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea) were consistent with the overall study population. CONCLUSION: The strong efficacy and favorable benefit-risk profile of DMF extends to Japanese, and more broadly, East Asian patients with RRMS.

    "AB": "CONTEXT: Deviations in scapular motions and subsequent alterations in associated soft tissues are thought to contribute to overuse shoulder injuries in overhead athletes. Whereas rigid and Kinesio taping are recommended for preventing these injuries, high-level evidence from clinical trials is still needed. OBJECTIVE: To determine and compare the short-term effects of rigid and Kinesio taping on scapular dyskinesis, scapular upward rotation, and pectoralis minor length in asymptomatic overhead athletes. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Athletic training rooms. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two elite asymptomatic overhead athletes (age = 17.00 +/- 4.09 years, height = 1.75 +/- 0.11 m, mass = 67.26 +/- 15.25 kg, body mass index = 21.80 +/- 3.00). INTERVENTION(S): We randomly assigned participants to 1 of 4 groups: rigid taping, Kinesio taping, placebo, or control (no taping). For the first 3 groups, we applied tape to the shoulder and scapular region. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We evaluated all groups for observable scapular dyskinesis using the scapular dyskinesis test, scapular upward rotation using a digital inclinometer, and pectoralis minor length using the pectoralis minor index at baseline, immediately after taping, and at 60 to 72 hours after taping. RESULTS: The scapular dyskinesis percentage ( P < .05) decreased and the pectoralis minor index ( P < .001) increased immediately and at 60 to 72 hours after taping in the rigid-taping and Kinesio-taping groups. We observed no differences among groups for the change in the pectoralis minor index ( P > .05). Scapular upward rotation did not change after taping in any group ( P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Rigid or Kinesio taping of the shoulder and scapular region improved scapular dyskinesis and pectoralis minor length but did not alter scapular upward rotation. Short-term rigid and Kinesio taping may help improve scapular dyskinesis and pectoralis minor length in overhead athletes.",

    "AB": "PURPOSE: To evaluate corneal endothelial cell density (ECD) and morphology 2 years after phacoemulsification in subjects from the COMPASS trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01085357) who had mild-to-moderate primary open-angle glaucoma and visually significant cataracts. METHODS: The central corneal endothelium was evaluated by serial specular microscopy at 0 to 24 months. ECD, coefficient of variation, and percentage of hexagonal cells were evaluated by a central image analysis reading center and central corneal thickness (CCT) was evaluated by ultrasound pachymetry. RESULTS: Of 131 subjects who underwent routine phacoemulsification, analyzable endothelial images at 24 months were available for 126 subjects (96.2%). Mean +/- SD central ECD at baseline was 2453 +/- 359 cells/mm, decreasing by 10% +/- 14% to 2195 +/- 517 cells/mm at 3 months (P < 0.001) but stabilizing thereafter with mean endothelial cell loss (ECL) from baseline to 24 months of 9% +/- 13% (P < 0.001). Twelve (9.5%) and 10 (7.9%) subjects experienced >30% ECL at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Neither coefficient of variation nor percentage of hexagonal cells changed significantly from baseline at any time point. Mean CCT was similar at baseline (550 +/- 35 mum) and at 12 months (551 +/- 37 mum) and 24 months (555 +/- 35 mum). Age was significantly associated with ECL after cataract surgery (P = 0.02), but baseline intraocular pressure, number of glaucoma medications, and CCT were not. Similar results were observed in patients who underwent CyPass micro-stent implantation accompanying phacoemulsification. CONCLUSIONS: Phacoemulsification in eyes with mild-to-moderate primary open-angle glaucoma results in early ECL, with ECD stabilizing after 3 months and no effect on other endothelial stress markers up to 2 years postoperatively.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of propofol sedation on psychological stress in patients undergoing surgery under epidural anesthesia. METHODS: Sixty patients scheduled to undergo elective ileostomy closure under epidural anesthesia were randomized into propofol sedation group and control group (n=30). The patients in the sedation group received a loading dose of propofol of 0.6 mg.kg(- 1). h(- 1) followed by a maintenance dose with continuous infusion of 3 mg.kg(- 1). h(- 1) given after the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) score reached 2-3. An equivalent volume of normal saline was administered in patients in the control group. The patients' preoperative and intraoperative anxiety scores were assessed with the State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) on the day before and on the first day after the surgery, respectively. The mean blood pressure (MBP), heart rate (HR), SpO2, OAA/S, and the indicators of psychological stress of brain functional state of the patients (including the wavelet index [WLi], anxiety index [ANXi], comfortable index [CFi] and pain index [Pi]) were recorded at 5 min after entering the operating room (T0), at the time of lumbar puncture (T1) and change to supine position after the puncture (T2), at 20 s (T3), 40 s (T4), and 60 s (T5) after intravenous administration, and at 2 min (T6), 4 min (T5), 6 min (T8), 8 min (T9), 10 min (T10) and 40 min (T11) after skin incision. The patient's satisfaction with anesthesia was assessed with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score on the first day after the operation. Serum cortisol level was measured before anesthesia and at the end of operation to calculate the changes in cortisol level. RESULTS: The two groups of patients were comparable for preoperative SAI scores (P&gt;0.05); The patients in the sedation group appeared to have lower intraoprative SAI scores, but this difference was not statistically significant (P=0.05). MBP, HR, and SpO2 at the time points from T6 to T10 and OAA/S, WLi, ANXi, CFi, and Pi at the time points from T6 to T11 were significantly lower in the sedation group (all P &lt; 0.05), and these parameters were not significantly different between the two groups at the other time points (all P&gt;0.05). The patient satisfaction scores were significantly higher in the sedation group (Z=2.07, P &lt; 0.05). Compared with the preoperative levels, serum cortisol level at the end of the operation was increased in the sedation group but lowered in the control group, and the variations of serum cortisol level differed significantly between the two groups (t=4.75, P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative propofol sedation can alleviate the patients' anxiety, improve the comfort level, and lessen physiological stress during surgeries under epidural anesthesia.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Ronghuang granule on serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFRs) and Klotho protein levels in non-dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) and kidney deficiency and damp heat syndrome. METHODS: Seventy non-dialysis CKD-MBD patients with kidney deficiency and dampness-heat syndrome were randomized into control group (n=35) and treatment group (n=35). All the patients were given routine treatment combined with traditional Chinese medicine retention enema, and the patients in the treatment group received additional Ronghuang granule treatment (3 times a day). After the 12-week treatments, the patients were examined for changes of TCM syndromes. Serum levels of Ca, P, parathyroid hormone (iPTH), FGF23, FGFRs and Klotho proteins were detected before and after treatment. These parameters were also examined in 20 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients completed the study, including 33 in the control group and 32 in the treatment group. The patients in the treatment group showed significantly better treatment responses than those in the control group (P &lt; 0.05 or 0.01). At 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment, the patients in the treatment group had significantly lowered scores of TCM syndromes compared with the score before treatment (P &lt; 0.05 or 0.01), while in the control group, significant reduction of the scores occurred only at 12 weeks (P &lt; 0.05); at each of the time points, the treatment group had significantly greater reductions in the score than the control group (P &lt; 0.01). Significant improvements in serum Ca, P and iPTH levels were observed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks in the treatment group (P &lt; 0.05) but only at 12 weeks in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The patients in the control and treatment groups all showed elevated serum levels of FGF23, FGFRs and Klotho protein compared with the normal subjects (P &lt; 0.01); FGF23, FGFRs and Klotho levels were significantly reduced in the treatment group (P &lt; 0.05) but remained unchanged in the control group (P&gt;0.05), showing significant differences between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Ronghuang granule improves the clinical symptoms of non-dialysis CKD-MBD patients with kidney deficiency and dampness heat syndrome by reducing serum levels of FGF23, FGFRs and Klotho, improving calcium and phosphorus metabolism disorder, and inhibiting secondary hyperparathyroidism.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend macrolides and fluoroquinolones in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but their use has been associated with cardiac events. We quantified associations between macrolide and fluoroquinolone use and cardiac events in patients hospitalized with CAP in non-ICU wards. METHODS: This was a post-hoc analysis of a cluster-randomized trial as a cohort study; including patients with a working diagnosis of CAP admitted to non-ICU wards without a cardiac event on admission. We calculated cause-specific hazard ratio's (HR's) for effects of time-dependent macrolide and fluoroquinolone exposure as compared to beta-lactam monotherapy on cardiac events, defined as new or worsening heart failure, arrhythmia, or myocardial ischemia during hospitalization. RESULTS: Cardiac events occurred in 146 (6.9%) of 2107 patients, including heart failure (n = 101, 4.8%), arrhythmia (n = 53, 2.5%), and myocardial ischemia (n = 14, 0.7%). These occurred in 11 of 207 (5.3%), 18 of 250 (7.2%), and 31 of 277 (11.2%) patients exposed to azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin for at least one day, and in 9 of 234 (3.8%), 5 of 194 (2.6%), and 23 of 566 (4.1%) exposed to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin, respectively. HR's for erythromycin, compared to beta-lactam monotherapy, on any cardiac event and heart failure were 1.60 (95% CI 1.09;2.36) and 1.89 (95% CI 1.22;2.91), respectively. HR's for levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, compared to beta-lactam monotherapy, on any cardiac event were 0.40 (95% CI 0.18;0.87)and 0.56 (95% CI 0.36;0.87), respectively. Findings remained consistent after adjustment for confounders and/or in a sensitivity analysis of radiologically confirmed CAP (n = 1604, 76.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with CAP hospitalized to non-ICU wards, erythromycin use was associated with a 68% increased risk of hospital-acquired cardiac events, mainly heart failure. Levofloxacin and moxifloxacin were associated with a lower risk of heart failure. Although our study does not fully exclude confounding bias, findings remained largely unchanged in crude, adjusted, and sensitivity analyses. These findings may caution the use of erythromycin as empirical therapy in these patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The original trial was retrospectively registered under ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01660204 on August 8th, 2012.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity has increased significantly worldwide within the last decade. As obesity is recognised as a contributing factor when developing various health threatening chronic diseases, prevention initiatives focusing on weight loss are becoming more important. Because of the time spent at the workplace, workplaces can be optimal arenas for weight loss programs and these programs have been effective to decrease body weight. Thus, reasons for engaging in weight loss interventions needs exploring, in order to engage more workplaces in weight loss interventions. Such information provides important knowledge that may help to inform decisions of municipalities, employers and other public health decision makers, when and if implementing weight loss interventions. The aim of this study was therefore to explore reasons for employee engagement in weight loss projects at the workplace and the incentives a municipality, a manager at a home-care centre, and a project manager have to launch such project. METHODS: A stratified case study was conducted. A representative from the municipality, the manager at a home-care centre, the project manager of the weight loss intervention and six health-care workers were interviewed at the end of a one-year weight loss intervention at the workplace. Data were analysed using Systematic Text Condensation. RESULTS: Analysis identified different views and considerations for engaging in a weight loss intervention at the workplace. For the representative of the municipality the possible economical gain of the project was in focus. The project manager and the manager of the home-care centre both reflected mainly on improvement of the healthcare workers health. For the project manager, achieving good scientific results was highlighted as well. However, the employees were influenced by several factors, such as their own health and weight loss, the pressure from the environment and their struggle for recognition. CONCLUSIONS: This study concluded that if targeting the increasing worldwide obesity problem through workplace initiated weight loss programs, the sales pitch to managements and employers have to be tailored in order to increase the participation and the motivation for the initiative.

    "AB": "AIM: To evaluate the impact of pharmacotherapeutic education on 30-day post-discharge medication adherence and adverse outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: The prospective, randomized, single-center study was conducted at the Medical Department of University Hospital Dubrava, Zagreb, between April and June 2018. One hundred and thirty adult patients with T2DM who were discharged to the community were randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control group. Both groups during the hospital stay received the usual diabetes education. The intervention group received additional individual pre-discharge pharmacotherapeutic education about the discharge prescriptions. Medication adherence and occurrence of adverse outcomes (adverse drug reactions, readmission, emergency department visits, and death) were assessed at the follow-up visit, 30 days after discharge. RESULTS: The number of adherent patients was significantly higher in the intervention group (57/64 [89.9%] vs 41/61 [67.2%]; chi2 test, P=0.003]. There was no significant difference between the groups in the number of patients who experienced adverse outcomes (31/64 [48.4%] vs 36/61 [59.0%]; chi2 test, P=0.236). However, higher frequencies of all adverse outcomes were consistently observed in the control group. CONCLUSION: Pharmacotherapeutic education of patients with T2DM can significantly improve 30-day post-discharge medication adherence, without a significant reduction in adverse clinical outcomes.

Patients were enrolled after the diagnosis of resectable or borderline resectable by portal vein involvement pancreatic cancer with histological confirmation. They were randomly assigned to either neoadjuvant chemotherapy or upfront surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy using S-1 was administered for 6 months to patients with curative resection who fully recovered within 10 weeks after surgery in both arms. The primary endpoint is overall survival; secondary endpoints include adverse events, resection rate, recurrence-free survival, residual tumor status, nodal metastases and tumor marker kinetics. The target sample size was required to be at least 163 (alpha-error 0.05; power 0.8) in both arms. A total of 360 patients were required after considering ineligible cases.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess whether an ultrasound (US)-guided oblique subcostal transversus abdominis plane (OSTAP) block would improve the postoperative pain scores and decrease the tramadol consumption after a laparoscopic hysterectomy. METHODS: Sixty-six female patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists I, II, or III, aged 18 to 65 years who were scheduled for laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign gynecologic pathologies were recruited in this randomized, controlled, observer-blinded trial. Sixty patients completed the study. Patients were randomized into 2 groups. In the OSTAP group, the patients received a bilateral OSTAP block with 40 mL of 0.375% bupivacaine and in the Sham group received an US-guided bilateral OSTAP with 40 mL of 0.9% saline. All patients received tramadol patient-controlled analgesia for the first 24th hour. Patients in the Sham group received an US-guided bilateral OSTAP with 40 mL of 0.9% saline. The primary outcome was the 24th hour tramadol consumption. The secondary outcomes included visual analog scale (VAS) scores during movement, the tramadol consumption at the 1st, 4th, and 12th postoperative hours, and nausea scores at the 24th hour postoperatively. RESULTS: At all time points, tramadol consumption of the OSTAP group remained significantly lower when compared with Sham group. The OSTAP group showed a statistically significant reduction at the postoperative 24th hour tramadol consumption (mean difference 22 mg, 95% confidence interval -38.4 to -5.6 mL; P = .009). Compared with the Sham group, OSTAP block reduced the VAS scores at all time points during movement. Nausea scores at the 24th postoperative hour were significantly lower in the OSTAP group compared with the Sham group CONCLUSION:: We concluded that bilateral US-guided OSTAP blocks reduced 24th hour tramadol requirements and VAS scores after laparoscopic hysterectomy. The OSTAP block is a promising technique for producing effective and prolonged postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy surgeries.",

METHODS: A total of 320 treatment-naive HBeAg-positive CHB patients who received randomly a single regimen of either entecavir capsule (ETV) (n = 160) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate capsule (TDF) (n = 160) for 144 weeks were consecutively enrolled from 14 tertiary hospitals or university hospitals in China between January 2012 and December 2014. RESULTS: Two groups showed no difference in baseline characteristics. After 144 weeks of treatment, HBV DNA levels were similarly suppressed in both groups (ETV vs TDF; -6.6485 vs -6.692 log10IU/mL, P = .807). At the same time, both groups showed no difference in terms of the serologic and biochemical response. Of all patients, 2 dropped out due to adverse events and 5 experienced serious adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: Both capsules (ETV or TDF) were equally effective in nucleos(t)ide-naive CHB patients with a comparable side-effect profile even in a long-term of 144 weeks.",

    "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Halitosis is the term used to describe any unpleasant odor relative to expired air regardless of its source. The prevalence of halitosis in the population is approximately 30%, of which 80 to 90% of the cases originate in the oral cavity resulting from proteolytic degradation by gram negative anaerobic bacteria. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) has been widely used with very satisfactory results in the health sciences. It involves the use of a non-toxic dye, called photosensitizer (FS), and a light source of a specific wavelength in the presence of the environmental oxygen. This interaction is capable of creating toxic species that generate cell death. The objective of this controlled clinical study is to verify the effect of aPDT in the treatment of halitosis by evaluating the formation of volatile sulphur compounds with gas chromatography and microbiological analysis before and after treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Young adults in the age group between 18 and 25 years with diagnosis of halitosis will be included in this research. The selected subjects will be divided into 3 groups: G1: aPDT; G2: scraper, and G3: aPDT and scraper. All subjects will be submitted to microbiological analysis and evaluation with Oral ChromaTM before, immediately after treatment, 7, 14, and 30 days after treatment. For the evaluation of the association of the categorical variables the Chi-square test and Fisher's Exact Test will be used. To compare the means the student t test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used and to analyse the correlation between the continuous variables the correlation test by Pearson will be applied. In the analyses of the experimental differences in each group the Wilcoxon test will be used. For all analyses a level of significance of 95% (P < .05) will be considered. DISCUSSION: Halitosis treatment is a topic that still needs attention. The results of this trial could support decision-making by clinicians regarding aPDT using aPDT for treating halitosis.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: This study assessed the effectiveness and safety of ultrasound-guided pulsed radiofrequency (UGPRF) for patients with frozen shoulder (FS). METHODS: This study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, sham control trial. A total of 136 patients with FS were recruited and then were equally randomly allocated into a treatment group (n = 68) and a sham group (n = 68). The patients in the treatment group received UGPRF, while the subjects in the sham group underwent sham UGPRF. Patients in both groups were treated for a total of 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the pain intensity, measured by the visual analog scale (VAS). The secondary outcomes consisted of shoulder disorder, measured by the score of shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI); quality of life, assessed by the Short Form-36 questionnaire (SF-36); and any adverse events (AEs) during the treatment period. All outcomes were measured at baseline, at the end of 6-week, and 12-week treatment. RESULTS: At the end of 6 weeks, and 12 weeks, UGPRF showed more promising outcome results in pain relief, as measured by VAS (P <.01), improvement of shoulder disorder, as assessed by SPADI score (pain, P <.01; disability, P <.01; total, P <.01), and enhancement of quality of life, as measured by the SF-36 scale (PCS, P <.01; MCS, P <.01), compared with sham UGPRF in this study. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study showed that UGPRF may benefit for patients with FS after 12 weeks treatment.",

METHODS: A total of 46 eligible patients with acute tinnitus were entered and included in this randomized controlled trial. All the included patients were equally and randomly divided into a verum TENS group and a sham TENS group, each group 23 participants. All patients received parenteral intramuscular therapy of 1 ml Vitamin B12 weekly for a total of 4 weeks. In addition, they also underwent verum or sham TENS 30 min daily, 3 times weekly for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was measured by the Tinnitus Severity Scale (TSS) and Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ) sum score. The secondary efficacy endpoints were assessed by the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) questionnaire, and adverse events. All outcome efficacy endpoints were measured at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: After 4-week treatment, the patients undergoing verum TENS showed statistically efficacy of symptoms relief, as measured by the scales of TSS (P < .01), TQ (P < .01), and THI (P < .01), and improvement of quality of life, as assessed by the SF-12 (P < .01), compared with patients receiving sham TENS. In addition, no adverse events related to the treatment were recorded in either group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that verum TENS may benefit patients with acute tinnitus after 4 weeks of treatment.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Truckers in sub-Saharan Africa are at higher risk of contracting HIV than the general population. HIV self-testing may be a way to increase testing rates in this high-risk population. The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to assess whether informing truckers who do not test for HIV regularly about the availability of HIV self-testing kits at roadside wellness centers in Kenya using text messages would increase HIV testing rates compared to the current program in which they are sent text messages about the availability of HIV testing in general. METHODS: A sample of 2262 male truckers registered in the North Star Alliance electronic health record system who, based on these records, were not testing for HIV regularly were randomized to one of three study groups in which they were sent text messages about the availability of (1) oral HIV self-test kits at all 8 North Star Alliance Kenya clinics that was sent three times (intervention), (2) HIV testing in general (not self-testing) at all North Star Alliance clinics sent three times (enhanced standard of care [SOC]), or (3) HIV testing in general (not self-testing) at all North Star Alliance clinics sent one time (SOC). We looked at HIV testing over a 2-month study period following the first text. RESULTS: Truckers in the intervention group were significantly more likely to test for HIV compared to those in the enhanced SOC (OR = 2.7, p = 0.009). There was no difference in HIV testing between those in the enhanced SOC and the SOC groups. Of those in the intervention group who tested, 64.5% chose the self-test and 35.5% chose the standard provider-administered blood-based HIV test. Although the intervention more than doubled HIV testing rates, because HIV testing rates were so low in this population (by design as we selected irregular testers), even in the intervention group more than 96% of participants did not test. CONCLUSIONS: Announcing the availability of HIV self-testing via text message increased HIV testing rates among truckers who were not regularly accessing HIV testing. However, self-testing is only a partial solution to increasing testing rates in this hard to reach population.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of mortality worldwide, with most deaths occurring in low-income countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) '5 Moments for Hand Hygiene' poster has been used to reduce hospital-acquired infections, but there is no similar tool to prevent community-acquired newborn infections in low-resource settings. This assessment, part of the BabyGel Pilot study, evaluated the acceptability of the 'Newborn Moments for Hand Hygiene in the Home' poster. This was an educational tool which aimed to remind mothers in rural Uganda to clean their hands to prevent neonatal infection. METHODS: The BabyGel pilot was a cluster randomised trial that assessed the post-partum use of alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) to prevent neonatal infections in Mbale, Uganda. Fifty-five women in 5 village clusters received the ABHR and used it from birth to 3 months postnatally, with use guided by the new poster. Following the study, 5 focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted consisting of 6-8 purposively sampled participants from intervention villages. FGDs were audio-recorded, transcribed then translated into English. Transcripts were inductively coded using ATLAS.ti(R) and qualitatively analysed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Most mothers reported that they understood the message in the poster (\"The picture shows me you must use these drugs to keep your baby healthy\") and that they could adhere to the moments from the poster. Some participants used the information from the poster to encourage other caregivers to use the ABHR (\"after explaining to them, they liked it\"). Other potential moments for hand hygiene were introduced by participants, such as after tending to domestic animals and gardening. CONCLUSION: The poster was well-received, and participants reported compliance with the moments for hand hygiene (although the full body wipe of the baby has since been removed). The poster will be adapted into a sticker format on the ABHR bottle. More focus could be put into an education tool for other caregivers who wish to hold the baby. Overall, the study demonstrated the acceptability of an adapted version of the WHO Moments for Hand Hygiene poster in the introduction of an intervention in the community.

    "AB": "Objective: To investigate the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) or combination with tapered hypnotic agents. Methods: Seventy-five patients were randomized into either CBT-i group (n=37) or combination group (n=38). The duration of treatment lasted for 8 weeks. The efficacy was evaluated by Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Beck depression index (BDI) , Beck anxiety inventory (BAI) and sleep diary variables at baseline, middle and end of treatment. Results: (1)Compared with the results at baseline, the total scores of PSQI,BDI and BAI in both groups significantly decreased at the end of treatment: CBT-i group, PSQI (4.7+/-2.5) vs. (12.9+/-3.5); BDI (3.2+/-4.4) vs. (9.7+/-6.4); BAI (4.2+/-5.6) vs. (10.7+/-8.1); and combination group, PSQI (5.8+/-2.8) vs. (13.9+/-3.1); BDI (4.5+/-4.8) vs. (13.8+/-8.7); BAI (4.4+/-4.0) vs. (14.1+/-6.3) (all P<0.01). (2) Compared with the results at baseline, subjective sleep quality (SQ), sleep onset latency (SOL), sleep efficiency (SE), sleep disturbance (SD) and used sleep medication (USM) in PSQI in combination group significantly decreased at week 4 and 8 (all P<0.05) . The total sleep time (TST) and daytime dysfunction (DF) in PSQI significantly decreased at week 8 (both P<0.05) . (3) Compared with combination group, improvement of SOL and SE in CBT-i group was superior (both P=0.01). Conclusions: CBT-i for chronic insomnia is effective in both CBT-i alone and combination with tapered hypnotic agents. CBT-i group is superior in improving SOL and SE. Combination regimen in our study can significantly reduce the doses of medication.",

    "AB": "This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a 12-week high-intensity interval exercise (HIIT) training program involving suspension exercises (TRX) on the muscle strength, body composition, gait speed, and quality of life of older adults. A total of 82 older adults were randomly assigned to 3 groups: a HIIT group (n=28), a continuous intensity training group (MIIT group, n=27), or a control group (CG, n=27). Compared to MIIT and CG, participants of the HIIT group showed significant post-intervention improvements in BMI (p=.002 and p<.001, respectively) and gait speed (p<.001 for both). Handgrip strength increase was also observed after HIIT (p=.002), but no differences were observed with MIIT and CG. Compared with MIIT and control groups, HIIT showed improvements in the SF-36 domains: general health (p<.001 for both) health changes (p<.001 for both), vitality (p=.002 and p=.001 respectively) and physical functioning (p=.036 and p<.001 respectively). Our results suggest that a HIIT training program with TRX have benefits in BMI, handgrip strength, gait speed, and quality of life in older adults.",

    "AB": "A prenatal diet affects materno-foetal outcomes. This is a post hoc analysis of the St. Carlos gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) Prevention Study. It aims to evaluate the effect of a late first-trimester (>12 gestational weeks) degree of adherence to a MedDiet pattern-based on six food targets-on a composite of materno-foetal outcomes (CMFCs). The CMFCs were defined as having emergency C-section, perineal trauma, pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia, prematurity, large-for-gestational-age, and/or small-for-gestational-age. A total of 874 women were stratified into three groups according to late first-trimester compliance with six food targets: >12 servings/week of vegetables, >12 servings/week of fruits, <2 servings/week of juice, >3 servings/week of nuts, >6 days/week consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), and >/=40 mL/day of EVOO. High adherence was defined as complying with 5(-)6 targets; moderate adherence 2(-)4 targets; low adherence 0(-)1 targets. There was a linear association between high, moderate, and low adherence, and a lower risk of GDM, CMFCs, urinary tract infections (UTI), prematurity, and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) newborns (all p < 0.05). The odds ratios (95% CI) for GDM and CMFCs in women with a high adherence were 0.35((0.18(-)0.67), p = 0.002) and 0.23((0.11(-)0.48), p < 0.001), respectively. Late first-trimester high adherence to the predefined six food targets is associated with a reduction in the risk of GDM, CMFCs, UTI, prematurity, and SGA new-borns.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The use of resources, costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were assessed in the trial at six months and one year. Results were extrapolated to two years after randomization. Differences between treatment arms, based on the intention-to-treat principle, were adjusted for covariates and missing data were handled using multiple imputation. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated, with uncertainty around the values estimated using bootstrapping. RESULTS: Cumulative mean QALYs/mean costs of health care service use and surgery per patient from baseline to 12 months were estimated as 0.640 (standard error (se) 0.024)/ pound3147 (se 166) in the decompression arm, 0.656 (se 0.020)/ pound2830 (se 183) in the arthroscopy only arm and 0.522 (se 0.029)/ pound1451 (se 151) in the no treatment arm. Statistically significant differences in cumulative QALYs and costs were found at six and 12 months for the decompression versus no treatment comparison only. The probabilities of decompression being cost-effective compared with no treatment at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20 000 per QALY were close to 0% at six months and approximately 50% at one year, with this probability potentially increasing for the extrapolation to two years. DISCUSSION: The evidence for cost-effectiveness at 12 months was inconclusive. Decompression could be cost-effective in the longer-term, but results of this analysis are sensitive to the assumptions made about how costs and QALYs are extrapolated beyond the follow-up of the trial.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Deterioration in ventricular function is often observed in patients treated with anthracyclines for cancer. There is a paucity of evidence on interventions that might provide cardio-protection. We investigated whether prophylactic use of carvedilol can prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and whether any observed effect is dose related. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind study in patients treated with doxorubicin, comparing placebo (n=38) with different doses of carvedilol [6.25mg/day (n=41), 12.5mg/day (n=38) or 25mg/day (n=37)]. The primary endpoint was the measured change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from baseline to 6 months. RESULTS: LVEF decreased from 62+/-5% at baseline to 58+/-7% at 6-months (p=0.002) in patients assigned to placebo but no statistically significant changes were observed in any of the 3 carvedilol groups. At 6 months, only one of 116 patients (1%) assigned to carvedilol had an LVEF<50% compared to four of the 38 assigned to placebo (11%), (p=0.013). No significant differences were noted between carvedilol and placebo in terms of the development of diastolic dysfunction, clinically overt heart failure or death. CONCLUSIONS: Carvedilol might prevent deterioration in LVEF in cancer patients treated with doxorubicin. This effect may not be dose related within the studied range.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Primary objective was to compare the effects of atorvastatin 40mg vs 80mg on LDL-C in Indian patients with atherosclerotic dyslipidemia. Secondary objectives were to compare the effects of atorvastatin 40mg vs 80mg on HDL-C and triglycerides and also comparing of side effects (myopathy, hepatotoxicity and new onset diabetes mellitus) of both doses. METHOD: This Study is A Prospective, randomized, open-label, comparative study. This study was conducted on 240 patients of dyslipidemia (as per ACC/AHA 2013 lipid guidelines) attending the OPD/wards/CCU of department of cardiology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. They were randomly divided into 2 groups of 120 each. Group A consisted patients who received Atorvastatin 40mg daily and Group B Atorvastatin 80mg daily. The follow up period was 6 months. RESULTS: At 3 and 6 month follow up, Atorvastatin 40mg leads to mean LDL cholesterol reduction of 47.18+/-20.81 & 50.03+/-18.06 respectively. While Atorvastatin 80mg results in LDL reduction as 50.11+/-15.85 & 52.30+/-13.72. The comparison between two doses revealed a non-significant difference (p=.118 & p=.149 respectively). At 6 months of follow up, few patients reported myalgia (2 in group A and 7 in Group B). The difference between groups was significant (p=.045). Although none of our patient had significant elevation of CPK. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that both doses of atorvastatin (40 & 80mg) are equally efficacious in improving dyslipidemia but higher dose leads to more incidence of myalgia.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: The lack of surveillance system is a major barrier in prevention and control of rheumatic fever/rheumatic heart disease (RF/RHD). Efficacy of school-based surveillance was evaluated for detection of acute pharyngitis and RF/RHD in Shimla district, HP. METHODS: The schools in district Shimla were randomly assigned to intervention and controlled arm (442 vs. 441 schools). The trained nodal teachers reported children with symptoms of acute pharyngitis and or RF/RHD in intervention arm and children taken to hospitals by parents for symptoms of acute pharyngitis and or RF/RHD under control arm through mobile phone to coordinating centre. Final outcome for presence of RF/RHD or other heart Diseases was recorded after examination at nearest primary health centers and/or at Indira Gandhi Medical College Hospital, Shimla. Difference in detection rate between intervention arm and control arm was compared using Z test. RESULTS: The number of school children reported from intervention group was significantly higher than in control due to suspected symptoms of acute pharyngitis and or RF/RHD were 65 (2.84/1000) and 15 (0.60/1000), respectively (p<0.01). Only 4 children in each arm were found to have heart diseases, with prevalence of (0.17/1000 and 0.16/1000), respectively, after clinical and echocardiography evaluation. In intervention arm, one child had RHD while three had congenital heart disease; in control arm, one child had congenital heart disease and three had RHD. CONCLUSIONS: School based surveillance had higher rate of suspecting children with acute pharyngitis and or RF/RHD although with low specificity. There is a need of future studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed intervention in endemic regions of the state.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Data regarding efficacy comparison of daily regimen (DR) versus every other day regimen (EODR) atorvastatin therapy is not validated by estimation of serum hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) levels and HMGCR correlation with lipid indices. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, we compared the efficacy of DR versus EODR by measuring lipid indices and serum HMGCR levels at baseline and after 12 weeks of 10mg atorvastatin therapy. Primary endpoint was comparison of mean change in serum HMGCR levels and lipid indices of both groups and their correlation with each other. Secondary endpoints were assessed by estimating serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase MM (CK-MM) levels and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). RESULTS: A total of 61 patients were enrolled of which 46 completed the study (24 in DR vs 22 in EODR group). The mean reduction in total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) was significantly higher in DR group, whereas mean reduction in triglycerides (TG) and increase in HDL-C was similar in both the groups. Reduction in serum HMGCR levels was comparable in both the groups (31.17% vs 28.19%). Change in serum HMGCR levels correlated more with change in lipid indices of DR group. Also, safety parameters were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Both the regimens achieved therapeutic goals, however DR was found to be superior as it achieved greater reduction in TC and LDL-C. Further, these findings are substantiated by correlation of lipid indices with serum HMGCR levels.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Head to head trials of clinical outcomes of sirolimus eluting polymer free vs. biodegradable polymer stents are lacking. METHODS: Single centre prospective open labeled randomised controlled clinical trial. Basis for sample size calculation was the rate of MACE from the ISAR TEST 3 trial in which the absolute difference was 10.25% with a standard deviation of 0.24. Assuming null hypothesis, 80% power and 5% alpha error, to detect a 10% difference, adjusting for 10% loss of follow up, sample size was 204. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients with stable coronary artery disease or recent acute coronary syndrome ( >1 week from the date of STEMI), being taken up for elective angioplasty. END POINTS: Primary end point was MACE at 1 year and secondary end points at the end of 1 year were cardiac death, urgent target lesion revascularization, acute coronary syndrome, stroke and in-stent re-stenosis. RESULTS: 204 patients were enrolled between January 2013 to July 2014, 91 in the polymer-free group and 113 in the biodegradable polymer group. Baseline characteristics were comparable between both groups. 21 patients (10.29%), were lost to follow up. MACE at 1 year were comparable in both the groups 3 of 85(3.52%) in the polymer-free group and 3 of 98(3.06%) in the biodegradable polymer group, p = 0.859. The secondary end points were also comparable between the two groups- Death- 1 of 85(1.17%) vs. 2 of 98(2.04%), p = 0.646, Stroke 0 of 85 vs. 2 of 98(2.04%), p = 0.185 and acute coronary syndrome - 2 of 85(2.35%) vs. 1 of 98(1.02%), p = 0.204. There were no instances of urgent target lesion re-vascularisation or definite stent thrombosis in either groups. In stent re-stenosis was found in 7 of 85(8.2%) in the polymer-free group vs. 6 of 98(6.12%) in the biodegradable polymer group. CONCLUSION: The 1 year MACE rates are comparable in patients who underwent elective coronary revascularization using sirolimus eluting polymer-free and biodegradable polymer stents.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Although conventional 60 mg of prasugrel allows for rapid and potent platelet inhibition within 30 min after loading dose, the efficacy and safety of lower doses of prasugrel in Indian patients has not yet been investigated. OBJECTIVE: The study sought to compare the efficacy of a lower loading dose of prasugrel with conventional loading dose of prasugrel in Indian patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three hundred thirty-two Indian patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were enrolled in the study. Participants were randomly administered loading doses of prasugrel 60 mg (group A, n = 166) or 30 mg (group B, n = 166) before undergoing elective PCI in a 1:1 manner. Primary efficacy end point was composite of in-hospital death and stent thrombosis at 96 h, while safety end point was in-hospital bleeding. RESULTS: The two groups did not differ in their baseline characteristics. The primary efficacy end point was 0.6% in both the conventional 60 mg loading dose (LD) and lower 30 mg LD groups (p = not significant). Minor bleeding was significantly less in group B [Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 1, A = 6.63% vs B = 1.81%, odds ratio (OR) = 3.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.06-14.08, P = 0.05]. Major bleeding was higher in group A (A = 3.61%, vs B = 1.81%, OR = 2.04, 95% CI = 0.50-8.29, P = 0.50). CONCLUSION: In Indian patients, 30 mg of prasugrel loading is as effective as 60 mg of prasugrel with significantly less minor bleeding.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of combined aerobic and resistance training (CART) on heart rate variability in sedentary, hypertensive women. PARTICIPANTS: A total of twenty-eight hypertensive (Stage 1 and 2) sedentary women (Age 40.54+/-4.2 yrs; Height 155.14+/-5.4cm; Weight 70.96+/-10.2kg; BMI 29.6+/-4.4; Duration of HTN: 6.43+/-2.5 yrs) were recruited for the study. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to either the CART group that performed combined aerobic and resistance exercise of moderate intensity [aerobic exercise 50-80% of HRmax (maximum heart rate) and resistance exercises at 50-80% of 1 Repetition Maximum (RM)], 5 times/week for 4 weeks, or to the control group that followed conventional treatment without any supervised exercise intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Resting blood pressure was measured and standard heart rate variability (HRV) indices were calculated using time domain (SDNN, pNN50, RMSSD) and frequency domain (LFnu, HFnu, LF/HF and TP) analysis. RESULTS: CART group demonstrated an increase in HFnu, TP, SDNN, and RMSSD, (p<0.05) along with a significant decrease in LFnu, LF/HF ratio, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: CART showed significant improvement in HRV parameters indicating vagal dominance in middle-aged hypertensive women. Therefore, exercise training in combined form (aerobic and resistance) may be incorporated in the management programs of the patients suffering from hypertension in order to augment improvement in their cardiac autonomic control.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Occupational radiation exposureis a growing problem due to increasing number and complexity of interventional procedures.The RADPAD is a lead-free sterile drape containing bismuth and barium that reduces scatter radiation during fluoroscopic procedures. We aimed to study the radiation exposure reduction to operators with the use of RADPAD and also measureradiation doses in different angiographic projections. METHODS: 65 randomly selected patients undergoing elective complex percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures from January 2017 to 2017 were randomized in a 1:1 pattern with or without the RADPAD. Primary endpoint was the ratio of operator received dose in mrem to total radiation in Gyat the end of the procedure which was designated ''Relative operator exposure'', with or without RADPAD. RESULTS: Despite similar fluoroscopy times (20.4+/-9.4min with RADPAD vs. 19.4+/-9.2min without RADPAD, P=0.871) and total radiation dose (3.4+/-4.3 Gy with RADPAD vs. 2.3+/-1.4 Gy, P=0.198), the relative operator exposure was significantly less with RADPAD (1.39+/-0.95) as compared to no RADPAD group (2.27+/-1.4) (p=0.004) amounting to a 39% reduction. Additionally mean radiation dose per shoot of recorded Left anterior oblique (LAO) oriented projections was 34.4+/-15.7mGyvs 24.9+/-12.9 mGy for a non LAO oriented projection. (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: RADPAD significantly reduces radiation exposure to the primary operator during prolonged complex PCI procedures. Further, amongst all views, LAO views have significantly higher emitted radiation as compared to Non LAO views and need more radiation protection.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: The onset of puberty and menarche is a specifically vulnerable time for girls, during which they begin to show interest in the opposite sex, while becoming exposed to a myriad of external pressures, including sexual coercion or harassment from boys and men, expectations to marry from their families, and the need to perform well in primary school in order to qualify for secondary school. According to several qualitative studies in Africa, such pressures are exacerbated by girls' lack of knowledge of their bodies, their rights, and the implications of their decisions, and by their inability to manage puberty and adolescence safely and comfortably with appropriate menstrual health and hygiene management (MHM) products. The evaluation of the Nia Project is one of the first to analyze the individual and combined contributions of sanitary pads and provision of comprehensive reproductive health education on girls' education and reproductive health outcomes. METHODS: The design for the evaluation of the Nia Project is a longitudinal, cluster-randomized controlled trial consisting of a baseline survey with a cohort of Class 7 girls, a school quality survey, qualitative data collection, school attendance tracking, and an endline survey at the completion of the 18-month intervention period with the same cohort. The study involves 140 public primary schools in three rural sub-counties (Magarini, Kaloleni and Ganze) of Kilifi County in the Coastal area of Kenya. The research sample includes 3489 girls, with about 25 girls per school on average. Before program implementation, the schools were stratified by sub-county and randomized to one of four study arms (35 schools per arm): 1) control, 2) disposable sanitary pads distribution, 2) reproductive health education, and 4) sanitary pad distribution and reproductive health education. DISCUSSION: The evidence provided will inform program investment and design, and contribute to the literature on the effect of menstrual health-based interventions on girls' agency, safety and life outcomes.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Maintenance of effect following treatment with galcanezumab compared to placebo in adult patients with episodic or chronic migraine was evaluated. METHODS: In 2 similarly designed studies of patients with episodic migraine (6 months) and 1 study of patients with chronic migraine (3 months), patients randomized in a 1:1:2 ratio received a subcutaneous injection of galcanezumab 120 mg/month (after an initial loading dose of 240 mg) or 240 mg/month or placebo. Maintenance of effect during the double-blind phase was evaluated based on a comparison of the percentages of galcanezumab- and placebo-treated patients with maintenance of 30, 50, 75, and 100% response (defined as >/=30, >/=50, >/=75, and 100% reduction from baseline in monthly migraine headache days [MHD]) at an individual patient level. Logistic regression analyses were used for between treatment comparisons. RESULTS: A total of 1773 adult patients with episodic migraine (n = 444 for galcanezumab 120 mg; n = 435 for galcanezumab 240 mg; n = 894 for placebo for 2 studies pooled) and 1113 patients with chronic migraine (n = 278 for galcanezumab 120 mg; n = 277 for galcanezumab 240 mg; n = 558 for placebo) were evaluated. In patients with episodic migraine, >/=50% response was maintained in 41.5 and 41.1% of galcanezumab-treated patients (120 mg and 240 mg, respectively) for >/=3 consecutive months (until patient's endpoint) and 19.0 and 20.5%, respectively, for 6 consecutive months and was significantly greater than the 21.4 and 8.0% of placebo-treated patients at >/=3 and 6 months consecutively (P < 0.001). Approximately 6% of galcanezumab-treated patients maintained >/=75% response all 6 months versus 2% of placebo-treated patients. Few galcanezumab-treated patients maintained 100% response. In patients with chronic migraine, 29% of galcanezumab-treated patients maintained >/=30% response all 3 months compared to 16% of placebo patients while >/=50% response was maintained in 16.8 and 14.6% of galcanezumab-treated patients (120 mg and 240 mg) and was greater than placebo (6.3%; p < 0.001). Few patients maintained >/=75% response. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with galcanezumab 120 mg or 240 mg demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful persistence of effect in patients with episodic migraine (>/=3 and 6 consecutive months) and in patients with chronic migraine (for 3 months).

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Recently, a novel approach with delaying the start of controlled ovarian stimulation along with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist pretreatment for 7 days after estrogen priming for further suppression of endogenous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) during the early follicular phase, resulting in more FSH-responsive follicles and thus improving synchronous follicular development was introduced. Two clinical trials have examined this strategy and reported controversial results. This study aimed to compare the effect of delayed-start GnRH antagonist protocol and standard GnRH antagonist in patients with poor ovarian response (POR) undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF)/ intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted at infertility department of Royan Institute from January 2017 to June 2018. Poor ovarian response was defined according to the Bologna criteria. The eligible women were randomly allocated into an experimental and control groups. In experimental group, patients received delayed-start GnRH antagonist protocol with estrogen priming followed by early follicular-phase GnRH antagonist treatment for 7 days before ovarian stimulation with gonadotropin and in control group, patients treated with estrogen priming antagonist protocol. IVF/ICSI outcomes were compared between groups. RESULTS: Among all the 250 patients examined 156 women were eligible for study and finally 120 patients were allocated to intervention (n = 60) and control (n = 60) groups. Demographic characteristics and hormonal profiles of the patients did not differ between groups. The statistical analysis showed that there were significant differences between groups regarding the total dose of used gonadotropins (P < 0.001), stimulation duration (P < 0.001), number of retrieved oocytes (P = 0.01) and top quality embryo (P < 0.001) and also cancellation (P = 0.002) and fertilization rates (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: On the basis of present results the delayed-start protocol in poor responders can improve the fertilization rate and quality of embryos and reduce the cycle cancellation but have no significant effect on clinical pregnancy rate; however, larger randomized clinical trials are required to compare it with other protocols.

The present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of TEAS on the effective concentration (EC50) of remifentanil suppressing tracheal extubation response in elderly patients.Fifty-three patients undergoing spine surgery were randomly divided into 2 groups: control group (group C, n = 26) and transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation group (group TEAS, n = 27). The EC50 values for remifentanil TCI were determined using sequential method and probit analysis.The remifentanil EC50 of that suppressed responses to extubation during anesthetic emergence was 1.20 ng/mL in group TEAS, a value that was significantly lower than the 1.64 ng/mL needed by patients in group C.The TEAS can enhance the efficacy of remifentanil on suppressing responses to tracheal extubation in elderly patients, the EC50 of remifentanil can reduce approximately 27% compared with group C.",

METHODS: A total of 100 children with chronic constipation were included in this randomized controlled trial. They were equally and randomly allocated to a treatment group (n = 50) and a placebo group (n = 50). The participants in the treatment group received lactulose, while the subjects in the placebo group received placebo intervention. The children in both groups were treated for a total of 6 weeks. The primary outcome was daily stool frequency. The secondary outcomes consisted of stool consistency, measured by the Bristol Stool Form Scale, abdominal pain, flatulence, as well as the adverse events. All outcomes were measured at baseline and after 6-weeks treatment. RESULTS: After 6 weeks treatment, lactulose showed better outcomes in daily stool frequency (P < .01), and stool consistency (P < .01), except the abdominal pain (P = .24), and flatulence (P = .44), compared with the placebo. Additionally, no significant differences regarding all adverse events were detected between 2 groups. CONCLUSION: The results of this study found that lactulose is efficacious for Chinese children with chronic constipation after 6-weeks of treatment.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is often used for the treatment of low-back pain (LBP). However, its effectiveness is controversial. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of TENS in the treatment LBP when associated to a therapeutic education program (TEP). DESIGN: Open randomized monocentric study. SETTING: University hospital between 2010 and 2014. PATIENTS: A total of 97 patients suffering from LBP. INTERVENTIONS: Routine care (TENS group) or routine care plus a therapeutic education program (TENS-TEP group) based on consultation support by a pain resource nurse. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: EIFEL and Dallas Pain Questionnaire scores. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (44%) were still assessable at the end-of-study visit, whereas 33 (70%) were assessable at the same time point in the TENS-TEP group (P = .013). The EIFEL score and the Dallas score had a similar evolution over time between groups (P = .18 and P = .50 respectively). Similarly, there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to resting pain scores (P = .94 for back pain and P = .16 for leg pain) and movement pain scores (P = .52 for back pain and P = .56 for leg pain). At Month 6, there was no significant difference between the groups (P = .85) with regard to analgesics and social impact. Two patients presented a serious adverse event during the study (one in each group) but non-attributable to the treatment studied. CONCLUSION: This study does not support the use of TENS in the treatment of patients with chronic LBP even though patients benefited from a therapeutic education program by a pain resource nurse. However, the higher number of premature withdrawals in the TENS group may be due to early withdrawal of patients who did not experience improvement of their symptoms.",

METHODS: A total of 82 patients with UIAS were randomly assigned to 2 groups that received NMES therapy (NMES group) or sham NMES (sham group) for 10 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoints were measured by urodynamic values, and Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS). The secondary efficacy endpoints were assessed by International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) score, Barthel Index (BI) scale, and adverse events. All outcomes were evaluated at baseline and at the end of 10 weeks treatment. RESULTS: After 10-week treatment, the patients received NMES therapy showed better efficacy in primary endpoints of urodynamic values (P <.01) and OABSS (P <.01), and secondary endpoints of ICIQ-SF (P <.01) and BI (P <.01), compared with patients who underwent sham NMES. No adverse events were recorded in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we demonstrated that 10 weeks of NMES therapy was efficacious in patients with UIAS.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Based on our pre-clinical data, we hypothesized that sequencing chemotherapy with erlotinib would increase the tumor response rate in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase II trial (planned n=58) using second-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer with either oxaliplatin-based (mFOLFOX6) or irinotecan-based (FOLFIRI) combination chemotherapy and 100 mg erlotinib daily on days 3-8 after each infusion (days 1 and 2) every 14 days. The primary endpoint was the response rate compared to the historical response rate. RESULTS: The FOLFIRI/erlotinib arm met the pre-specified response rate criteria of at least 10% to expand accrual to the intended sample size. The trial was halted after an interim safety analysis (n=11) due to excess grade 3 neutropenia, dose reductions and treatment delays. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was observed in 64% of patients. The response rate was 18%. CONCLUSION: In second-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer, mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI with erlotinib in a sequence-dependent fashion is not feasible despite potential promising activity.",

    "AB": "INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this research was to compare the effects of Herbst appliance therapy using incremental vs maximum advancement in late adolescent and young adult patients with Class II skeletal malocclusion. METHODS: Forty-two patients with skeletal Class II malocclusion were treated with cast-splint Herbst appliances. The subjects were randomly allocated into 2 groups according to activation type: incremental advancement (IA) and maximum advancement (MA). Initial forward movement in the IA group was 4 to 5 mm and was followed by subsequent bimonthly advancements of 2 mm. Single-step advancement was achieved in the MA group until an edge-to-edge incisor relationship or an overcorrected Class I molar relationship was obtained. Total treatment times were 9.7 +/- 1.1 months for the IA group and 9.5 +/- 1.1 months for the MA group. Dental, skeletal, and soft tissue measurements were performed on lateral cephalograms taken just before and at the end of the Herbst appliance therapy. Statistical significance was set at P </= 0.05. RESULTS: All mandibular skeletal dimensions increased, and improvements of the sagittal maxillomandibular parameters were found in both groups. Protrusion and proclination of the mandibular incisors were greater in the IA group (95.90 degrees +/- 5.34 degrees ) compared with the MA group (92.04 degrees +/- 7.92 degrees ). Other dentoalveolar changes in both groups were intrusion of the maxillary first molars, and extrusion of the mandibular first molars and maxillary incisors. The mentolabial sulcus was flattened, soft tissue convexity was reduced, and forward movement of mandibular soft tissues was seen after Herbst therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Similar skeletal, dental, and soft tissue changes were obtained in both groups after Herbst therapy. Greater proclination and more protrusion of the mandibular incisors were found in the IA group.",

    "AB": "INTRODUCTION: In this study, we aimed to compare the incidence of new demineralized lesions and bond failures between 2 groups of participants wearing fixed orthodontic appliances bonded with either light-cured resin-modified glass ionomer cement or light-cured composite. METHODS: This trial was a multicenter (6 centers: 2 teaching hospitals, 4 specialist orthodontic practices), single-blinded, randomized controlled trial with 2 parallel groups. Patients aged 11 years or older, in the permanent dentition, and about to start fixed orthodontic treatment in these 6 centers were randomly allocated to have either resin-modified glass ionomer cement or light-cured composite for bonding brackets, forward of the first molars. Pretreatment and day-of-debond digital photographic images were taken of the teeth and assessed by up to 5 clinical and 3 lay assessors for the presence or absence of new demineralized lesions and the esthetic impact. The assessors were masked as to group allocation. RESULTS: We randomized 210 participants, and 197 completed the trial. There were 173 with complete before-and after-digital images of the teeth. The incidence of new demineralized lesions was 24%; but when the esthetic impact was taken into account, this was considerably lower (9%). There was no statistically significant difference between the bracket adhesives in the numbers with at least 1 new demineralized lesion (risk ratio,1.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-2.13; P = 0.403) or first-time bracket failure (risk ratio,0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.67-1.16; P = 0.35). There were no adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that the use of resin modified glass ionomer cement over light-cured composite for bonding brackets reduces the incidence of new demineralized lesions or bond failures. There might be other reasons for using resin modified glass ionomer cement. REGISTRATION: This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.govNCT01925924. PROTOCOL: The protocol is available from the corresponding author on request.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Oscillatory positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) training is a kind of breathing exercise with Acapella. The clinical value of OPEP has been widely discussed in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis as well as pulmonary cyst. However, few studies have explored the application of OPEP in surgery lung cancer patients underwent lobectomy. Thus, the aim of this study is to explore the impact of the application of OPEP device (acapella) in lung cancer patients undergoing video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS). METHODS: Sixty-nine patients receiving VATS lobectomy in Department of Thoracic Surgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University from September 15, 2017 to January 15, 2018 were randomly divided into the acapella group (AG) or the control group (CG). The patients in the AG received oscillating positive expiratory pressure training and the CG underwent standard perioperative treatment. The differences of morbidity, pulmonary function, quality of life were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were assigned to the AG and thirty-four patients were assigned to the CG. The incidences of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) and atelectasis (2.9%, 0.0%) in the AG were significantly lower than that in the CG (20.6%, 14.7%)(P=0.03, P=0.03). The duration of total hospital stay and postoperative hospital stay in the AG (10.86+/-5.64, 5.09+/-4.55) d were significantly shorter than that in the CG (10.86+/-5.64, 5.09+/-4.55) d (P=0.01, P=0.01). The drug cost in the AG (4,413.60+/-1,772.35) yen were significantly lower than that in the CG (6,490.35+/-3,367.66) yen (P=0.01). The patients in the AG had better forced expiratory volume in the first second and peak expiratory flow [(1.50+/-0.32) L,(252.06+/-75.27) L/min] compared with the CG [(1.34+/-0.19) L, (216.94+/-49.72) L/min] (P=0.03, P=0.03) at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The application of OPEP device during the perioperative period was valuable in decreasing PPCs and enhancing recovery for lung cancer patients receiving VATS lobectomy.",

Dietary carbohydrate reduction has been suggested as non-pharmacological therapy for T2DM, but the acute effects on NEFA and TG during subsequent meals remain to be investigated. METHODS: Postprandial NEFA and TG responses were assessed in subjects with T2DM by comparing a carbohydrate-reduced high-protein (CRHP) diet with a conventional diabetes (CD) diet in an open-label, randomized, cross-over study. Each diet was consumed on two consecutive days, separated by a wash-out period. The iso-caloric CRHP/CD diets contained 31/54 E% from carbohydrate, 29/16 E% energy from protein and 40/30 E% from fat, respectively. Sixteen subjects with well-controlled T2DM (median HbA1c 47 mmol/mol, (37-67 mmol/mol) and BMI 30 +/- 4.4 kg/m(2)) participated in the study. NEFA and TG were evaluated following breakfast and lunch. RESULTS: NEFA net area under curve (AUC) was increased by 97 +/- 38 mumol/Lx270 min (p = 0.024) after breakfast but reduced by 141 +/- 33 mumol/Lx180 min (p < 0.001) after lunch on the CRHP compared with CD diet. Likewise, TG net AUC was increased by 80 +/- 28 mumol/Lx270 min (p = 0.012) after breakfast but reduced by 320 +/- 60 mumol/Lx180 min (p < 0.001) after lunch on the CRHP compared with CD diet. CONCLUSIONS: In well-controlled T2DM a modest reduction of dietary carbohydrate with a corresponding increase in protein and fat acutely reduced postprandial serum NEFA suppression and increased serum TG responses after a breakfast meal but had the opposite effect after a lunch meal. The mechanism behind this second-meal phenomenon of CRHP diet on important risk factors for aggravating T2DM and cardiovascular disease awaits further investigation.

    "AB": "Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicities of induction chronomodulated chemotherapy in comparison with conventional induction chemotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Patients and Methods: Between 2003 and 2004, 60 patients with pathologically confirmed NPC were included and randomly assigned to two groups. Patients in the chronomodulated chemotherapy group (n = 30, CC group) received cisplatin at 80 mg/m(2) through intravenous infusion from 10:00 to 22:00 and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at 1000 mg/m(2) plus citrovorum factor at 200 mg/m(2) from 22:00 to 10:00 each day for 3 days. Patients in the routine chemotherapy group (n = 30, RC group) received cisplatin infusion within 1 h and 5-FU infusion for about 24 h. The dose in the RC group was the same as that in the CC group. The total irradiation dose in each group was 70 Gy for the whole nasopharynx. Results: One month after induction chemotherapy, the overall response rate was 96.7% in the CC group versus 73.3% in the RC group (P = 0.011). By the end of the 10-year follow-up, 11 patients (36.7%) in the CC group had experienced local recurrence versus 11 patients (36.7%) in the RC group (P > 0.999). The overall survival rates at 1, 5, and 10 years were 96.7%, 53.3%, and 43.3%, respectively, in the CC group, and 96.7%, 43.3%, and 33.3%, respectively, in the RC group (P = 0.346). During induction chemotherapy, the incidence rates of leukocytopenia (43.3% vs. 80%, P = 0.003), thrombocytopenia (26.7% vs. 56.7%, P = 0.018), and nausea/vomiting (40% vs. 66.7%, P = 0.038) were significantly lower in the CC group than in the RC group. The incidence of radiation-induced complications was similar in these two groups. Conclusion: Compared with conventional chemotherapy, induction chrono-chemotherapy seemed to reduce chemotherapy-related toxicities and improve average local relapse time in patients treated with combined chemoradiotherapy for NPC.",

Materials and Methods: In this prospective study, 80 patients that underwent radical resection for colorectal cancer were randomly divided into four groups: (1) the parecoxib group, with preintravenous injection of parecoxib and postoperative PCIA after surgery; (2) the TAP group, with TAP block and postoperative PCIA; (3) the parecoxib + TAP group, with parecoxib combined with TAP block and postoperative PCIA; and (4) the control group, with only postoperative PCIA and preinjection of normal saline. The visual analog score was used to measure the pain. The mean operative time, PCIA pressing time, time for first out-of-bed activity, first anus exhaust time, hospital stay duration, and complications were recorded. Results: Operative time of the TAP group and parecoxib + TAP group was significantly longer than that of the parecoxib group and control group. The first out-of-bed activity time, first anus exhaust time, and hospital stay time of the parecoxib + TAP group were significantly shorter than those of the other groups, while the control group was all significantly higher than the other groups. Complication rates in all strategy groups were significantly lower than in the control group; however, no significant difference was found among the strategy groups. Conclusion: The combination of parecoxib, TAP, and PCIA pump could significantly reduce patient postoperative pain and enhance recovery.",

The BRPE could be a valuable tool for clinicians to dose FT intensity after a stroke, but this remains to be tested. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of the BRPE at grading FT intensity of the affected upper limb in older adults with a chronic stroke and secondarily to explore the clinical changes between FT and ST when the intensity is regulated with BRPE. Patients and methods: Twelve participants were randomized into a FT or ST group and trained their affected upper limb (3 times/week for 4 weeks) with the intensity standardized with BRPE. Feasibility was assessed by adherence, occurrence of adverse events, and comparison of BRPE ratings between groups. Clinical changes were defined as improvements on the Fugl-Meyer motor assessment (FMA) and Wolf motor function test (WMFT). Results: All participants adhered to FT/ST without adverse effects, and comparable BRPE ratings were noted between groups throughout the training (P>/=0.42). Both groups showed significant gains at the FMA (ST: 5+/-4 points/FT: 6+/-4 points; P=0.04) and WMFT (ST: 0.4+/-0.3 points/FT: 0.6+/-0.4 points; P=0.05), which were comparable between groups (P>/=0.47). Conclusion: The results suggest that it is feasible to use the BRPE scale to adjust FT intensity. Gains in motor function in both groups suggest that undergoing therapy, regardless of its type, might be a sufficient stimulus to produce gains when intensity is adequately adjusted. Further studies are needed to validate the current observations.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Magnesium (Mg) supplementation may help control glycemic response among type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. OBJECTIVE: This study means to determine whether Mg supplementation improves glycemic control indicators in patients with T2D. METHODS: After one week of the dietary stabilization phase, 42 T2D patients were stratified according to sex, age, fasting blood sugar (FBS) and Mg levels and then randomly allocated into two groups. The intervention group was on 250 mg/day of elemental Mg for three months while the control group did not receive any type of supplements throughout the intervention period. RESULTS: The daily administration of 250 mg of elemental Mg indicated a significant improvement in HbA1C (8.32 to 7.96%, p < 0.001), insulin levels (IL) (15.56 to 12.18 muIU/mL, p < 0.001), C-peptide (2.28 to 1.90 ng/mL, p = 0.001), HOMA.IR (6.16 to 4.44, p < 0.001) and HOMA.beta% (59.99 to 52.37, p = 0.036) of the intervention group when compared with the control group after three months of intervention. CONCLUSION: The results of this study revealed that oral Mg supplementation reduces insulin resistance and improves the glycemic control indicators among T2D patients.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation is the best treatment for end-stage liver disease. The interruption of the blood supply to the donor liver during cold storage damages the liver, affecting how well the liver will function after transplant. The drug Simvastatin may help to protect donor livers against this damage and improve outcomes for transplant recipients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the benefits of treating the donor liver with Simvastatin compared with the standard transplant procedure. PATIENT AND METHODS: We propose a prospective, double-blinded, randomized phase 2 study of 2 parallel groups of eligible adult patients. We will compare 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month graft survival after LT, in order to identify a significant relation between the two homogenous groups of LT patients. The two groups only differ by the Simvastatin or placebo administration regimen while following the same procedure, with identical surgical instruments, and medical and nursing skilled staff. To reach these goals, we determined that we needed to recruit 106 patients. This sample size achieves 90% power to detect a difference of 14.6% between the two groups survival using a one-sided binomial test. DISCUSSION: This trial is designed to confirm the effectiveness of Simvastatin to protect healthy and steatotic livers undergoing cold storage and warm reperfusion before transplantation and to evaluate if the addition of Simvastatin translates into improved graft outcomes.

    "AB": "Recent studies have demonstrated that the energy provided by several tree nuts is less than that predicted by the Atwater factors, though energy available from cashews has never been assessed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the metabolizable energy in cashew nuts. Eighteen healthy adults were enrolled in a randomized, crossover study with two treatment periods. Subjects were fed a fully controlled base diet for 4 weeks with either no additions or with the addition of 42 g/day (1.5 servings) of cashew nuts, with the final treatment diets being isocaloric. Complete diet collections were analyzed for nitrogen (for protein), fat, energy, and carbohydrate by difference. During the final week of each intervention phase, subjects collected all feces and urine produced, and these were also analyzed for nitrogen (feces and urine), energy (feces and urine), and fat (feces). The resulting data were used to calculate the metabolizable energy of cashews and the digestibility of macronutrients. The average available energy (calorie) content of a 28 g serving of cashew nuts was 137 kcal (+/-3.4 kcal SEM) and ranged from 105 to 151 kcal. The mean value of 137 kcal/serving is 16% lower (p < 0.0001) than what is typically found on food labels. Digestibility of energy, fat, protein, and carbohydrate was lower for the cashew-containing diet compared to the control diet (92.9% vs. 94.9%, p < 0.0001 for energy; 96.1% vs. 97.8%, p = 0.0009 for fat; 90.1% vs. 91.2%, p = 0.0012 for protein; 92.9% vs. 94.9%, p < 0.0001 for carbohydrate; for the cashew-containing diet vs. the control diet, respectively). In conclusion, cashews provide fewer calories than the values predicted by the Atwater factors, as found on current food labels.",

    "AB": "Background: A unique fixed combination halobetasol propionate 0.01% and tazarotene 0.045% (HP/TAZ) lotion has been shown to be effective in psoriasis using Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) tools to assess erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling. However, these do not consider changes in Body Surface Area (BSA). The IGAxBSA composite tool is a simple, effective, validated alternative for measuring improvement in psoriasis severity. It correlates well with the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and demonstrates sensitivity to changes from baseline in patients with both mild and moderately severe disease. Objective: To further define the role of a fixed combination halobetasol propionate 0.01% and tazarotene 0.045% (HP/TAZ) lotion in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis using the IGAxBSA composite tool. Methods: Post hoc analysis of 212 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis randomized (2:2:2:1) to HP/TAZ lotion, HP, TAZ, or vehicle once-daily for 8 weeks, with a 4-week posttreatment follow-up. Efficacy assessments using the validated IGAxBSA composite tool. Results: HP/TAZ lotion demonstrated statistically significant superiority at week 8 (versus TAZ and vehicle) and week 12 (versus HP, TAZ, and vehicle). By week 8, HP/TAZ lotion achieved a 63.5% reduction in mean IGAxBSA composite score (P<0.001 versus TAZ and vehicle), that was sustained four weeks posttreatment (P<0.001 versus TAZ and vehicle and P=0.003 versus HP). A 25% and 50% improvement in IGAxBSA was achieved within 1.9 and 4.6 weeks, respectively, and 47.5% of patients achieved IGAxBSA-75 by week 8. Limitations: This post hoc analysis was limited to patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis with IGA >/=3 and BSA involvement (3%-12%). Conclusions: HP/TAZ lotion was associated with significant and rapid reductions in disease severity as assessed by the IGAxBSA composite tool. The addition of tazarotene affords sustained benefits posttreatment. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(12):1290-1296.",

    "AB": "Intensive physical exercise may cause increase oxidative stress and muscular injury in elite football athletes. The aim of this study was to exploit the effect of cocoa polyphenols on oxidative stress and muscular injuries induced by intensive physical exercise in elite football players. Oxidant/antioxidant status and markers of muscle damage were evaluated in 24 elite football players and 15 controls. Furthermore, the 24 elite football players were randomly assigned to either a dark chocolate (>85% cocoa) intake (n = 12) or a control group (n = 12) for 30 days in a randomized controlled trial. Oxidative stress, antioxidant status, and muscle damage were assessed at baseline and after 30 days of chocolate intake. Compared to controls, elite football players showed lower antioxidant power and higher oxidative stress paralleled by an increase in muscle damage markers. After 30 days of dark chocolate intake, an increased antioxidant power was found in elite athletes assuming dark chocolate. Moreover, a significant reduction in muscle damage markers (CK and LDH, p < 0.001) was observed. In the control group, no changes were observed with the exception of an increase of sNox2-dp, H2O2, and myoglobin. A simple linear regression analysis showed that sNox2-dp was associated with a significant increase in muscle damage biomarker release (p = 0.001). An in vitro study also confirmed that polyphenol extracts significantly decreased oxidative stress in murine myoblast cell line C2C12-derived. These results indicate that polyphenol-rich nutrient supplementation by means of dark chocolate positively modulates redox status and reduced exercise-induced muscular injury biomarkers in elite football athletes. This trial is registered with NCT03288623.",

    "AB": "Based on the benefit of polyphenolic compounds on osteoporosis, we hypothesized that the polyphenol-rich herbal congee containing the combined extract of Morus alba and Polygonum odoratum leaves should improve bone turnover markers in menopausal women. To test this hypothesis, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study was performed. A total of 45 menopausal participants were recruited in this study. They were randomly divided into placebo, D1, and D2 groups, respectively. The subjects in D1 and D2 groups must consume the congee containing the combined extract of M. alba and P. odoratum leaves at doses of 50 and 1500 mg/day, respectively. At the end of an 8-week consumption period, all subjects were determined serum bone markers including calcium, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and beta CTX. In addition, the hematological and blood clinical chemistry changes, and total phenolic content in the serum were also determined. The results showed that the menopausal women in D2 group increased serum alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and total phenolic compounds content but decreased CTX level. Clinical safety assessment failed to show toxicity and adverse effects. Therefore, herbal congee containing the combined extract of M. alba and P. odoratum leaves is the potential functional food that can decrease the risk of osteoporosis.",

    "AB": "Introduction: Peri- and postmenopausal women frequently suffer from urinary incontinence (UI). Generally, UI becomes more severe with age. It impacts physical, mental, and social functioning as well as the quality of life, often leading to depression. Extracorporeal magnetic innervation (ExMI) is a relatively new conservative treatment method for UI. Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of ExMI in the treatment of stress UI in women. Methods: A total of 52 women were included in the analysis: 28 participants were allocated to the experimental group (EG) and 24 to the control group (CG). The average age was 65.41 years (+/-SD 4.08). EG patients completed ExMI therapy. The treatment sessions lasted for 15 minutes, and occurred three times a week, for 4 weeks. No therapeutic intervention was applied to the CG. To objectify the treatment outcomes in both groups before and after the treatment, we measured myostatin concentration and performed the UI severity assessment (The Revised Urinary Incontinence Scale), perceived self-efficacy assessment (General Self-Efficacy Scale), and depression severity assessment (Beck Depression Inventory). Results: The authors compared the EG results at the initial and final assessments and found a statistically significant improvement in severity of UI (P=0.001) and depression severity (P=0.006), and a decrease in myostatin concentration (P</=0.001). The authors did not find any statistically significant differences between all measured variables for the CG at the initial and final assessments. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences between all measured variables for the EG and the CG at the final assessment. Conclusion: Further trials are needed to determine optimal treatment protocols for various UI types and to evaluate long-term outcomes of the ExMI treatment.",

    "AB": "Objectives To determine the acceptability and feasibility of the use of a robotic walking aid to support the work of physiotherapists in reducing fear of falling in the rehabilitation of elderly patients with 'psychomotor disadaptation' (the most severe form of post-fall syndrome). Study design 20 participants with psychomotor disadaptation admitted to an academic rehabilitation ward were randomised to receive physiotherapist care supported by the SafeWalker(R) robotic walking aid or standard care only, for ten days. SafeWalker(R) supports the body weight whilst securing postural stability without relying on upper body strength or high cognitive demand. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was the feasibility and acceptability of rehabilitation sessions at five and ten days based on (i) questionnaires completed by patient and physiotherapist, (ii) the number of steps performed during sessions, (iii) replacement of a robotic session by a conventional one. Results The mean age of the participants was 85.2 years. They had lost their ability to perform some basic living activities. Patients in the intervention group found that the rehabilitation sessions were easier (p = 0.048). No robotic rehabilitation session had to be replaced by conventional rehabilitation. There were no statistical differences between the two groups on the other outcome measures. Conclusion We demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of the use of a robotic walking aid from the perspective of both older individuals and physiotherapists. This could fill the gap between devices that fully compensate for walking and those which allow patients to maintain residual mobility.",

    "AB": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States and emerging evidence supports that increased consumption of legumes, such as navy beans, can reduce risk. Navy bean consumption was previously shown to modulate host and microbiome metabolism, and this investigation was performed to assess the impact on the human stool metabolome, which includes the presence of navy bean metabolites. This 4-week, randomized-controlled trial with overweight and obese CRC survivors involved consumption of 1 meal and 1 snack daily. The intervention contained 35 g of cooked navy bean or macronutrient matched meals and snacks with 0 g of navy beans for the control group (n = 18). There were 30 statistically significant metabolite differences in the stool of participants that consumed navy bean at day 28 compared to the participants' baseline (p </= 0.05) and 26 significantly different metabolites when compared to the control group. Of the 560 total metabolites identified from the cooked navy beans, there were 237 possible navy bean-derived metabolites that were identified in the stool of participants consuming navy beans, such as N-methylpipecolate, 2-aminoadipate, piperidine, and vanillate. The microbial metabolism of amino acids and fatty acids were also identified in stool after 4 weeks of navy bean intake including cadaverine, hydantoin-5 propionic acid, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, and caprylate. The stool relative abundance of ophthalmate increased 5.25-fold for navy bean consumers that can indicate glutathione regulation, and involving cancer control mechanisms such as detoxification of xenobiotics, antioxidant defense, proliferation, and apoptosis. Metabolic pathways involving lysine, and phytochemicals were also modulated by navy bean intake in CRC survivors. These metabolites and metabolic pathways represent an acute response to increased navy bean intake, which merit further investigation for improving colonic health after long-term consumption.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical and programmatic feasibility of using 800 mug of sublingual misoprostol to prevent and treat postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) during home delivery. METHODS: The present double-blind randomized controlled trial included women who underwent home deliveries in Chitral district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan, after presenting at healthcare facilities during the third trimester of pregnancy between May 28, 2012, and November 27, 2014. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 800 mug of misoprostol or placebo sublingually if PPH was diagnosed, having previously received a prophylactic oral dose of 600 mug misoprostol. The primary outcome, hemoglobin decrease of 20 g/L or greater from pre- to post-delivery assessment, was compared on a modified intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: There were 49 patients allocated to receive misoprostol and 38 allocated to receive placebo; the incidence of a 20 g/L decrease in hemoglobin was similar between the groups (20/43 [47%] vs 19/33 [58%], respectively; P=0.335). CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in clinical outcomes between the two trial arms. ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT01485562.",

Baltimore Community-based Organizations Neighborhood Network: Enhancing Capacity Together (CONNECT) was a randomized, controlled trial based on the core tenets of the World Health Organization's (WHO) African Partnerships for Patient Safety Community Engagement (ACE) approach. OBJECTIVES: We describe a research protocol and lessons learned from a partnership between Johns Hopkins Health System and 11 CBOs. METHODS: Baltimore CONNECT involved 22 CBOs in East Baltimore randomized to a co-developed intervention bundle versus control. Data were from review of notes and minutes from meetings, and discussions with each CBO on value added by intervention elements and on impact of the project. LESSONS LEARNED: It is feasible to engage and maintain a network of CBOs linked with a local health system. CONCLUSIONS: The WHO ACE approach supported development and sustainment of a network of organizations linking health care and social services across East Baltimore.",

The primary outcome was the reduction in the incidence of CIN. The secondary outcomes were the maximum improvement in eGFR, maximum reduction in serum creatinine and composite of requirement of hemodialysis, death and rehospitalization for heart failure up to 6 weeks after PCI. RESULTS: Eleven out of fifty patients in the study group developed CIN (22%) compared to eighteen out of the fifty control patients (36%) (p=0.123). There was a statistically significant improvement in the post procedure creatinine values at 24h (p=0.013), 48h (p=0.015), 2 weeks (p=0.003), 6 weeks (p=0.003) and post procedure glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values at 24h (p=0.026), 48h (p=0.044), 2 weeks (p=0.015) and 6 weeks (p=0.011) in study group compared to control group. The secondary outcome composite of requirement of hemodialysis, death and rehospitalization for heart failure was not statistically significant (p: 0.646). CONCLUSION: RIPC does not result in significant reduction of CIN. However RIPC helps in the prevention of post procedural worsening in eGFR and serum creatinine even up to 6 weeks.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Persistent post-surgical pain and associated disability are common after a traumatic fracture repair. Preliminary evidence suggests that patients' beliefs and perceptions may influence their prognosis. METHODS: We used data from the Fluid Lavage of Open Wounds trial to determine, in 1560 open fracture patients undergoing surgical repair, the association between Somatic PreOccupation and Coping (captured by the SPOC questionnaire) and recovery at 1 yr. RESULTS: Of the 1218 open fracture patients with complete data available for analysis, 813 (66.7%) reported moderate to extreme pain at 1 yr. The addition of SPOC scores to an adjusted regression model to predict persistent pain improved the concordance statistic from 0.66 to 0.74, and found the greatest risk was associated with high (>/=74) SPOC scores [odds ratio: 5.63; 99% confidence interval (CI): 3.59-8.84; absolute risk increase 40.6%; 99% CI: 30.8%, 48.6%]. Thirty-eight per cent (484 of 1277) reported moderate to extreme pain interference at 1 yr. The addition of SPOC scores to an adjusted regression model to predict pain interference improved the concordance statistic from 0.66 to 0.75, and the greatest risk was associated with high SPOC scores (odds ratio: 6.06; 99% CI: 3.97-9.25; absolute risk increase: 18.3%; 95% CI: 11.7%, 26.7%). In our adjusted multivariable regression models, SPOC scores at 6 weeks post-surgery accounted for 10% of the variation in short form-12 physical component summary scores and 14% of short form-12 mental component summary scores at 1 yr. CONCLUSIONS: Amongst patients undergoing surgical repair of open extremity fractures, high SPOC questionnaire scores at 6 weeks post-surgery were predictive of persistent pain, reduced quality of life, and pain interference at 1 yr.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Precooling (PC) before exercise may help prevent severe hyperthermia and exertional heatstroke (EHS). Before clinicians can advocate PC as an EHS prevention strategy, it must effectively mitigate factors associated with EHS development while not lessening the effectiveness of EHS treatment. Therefore, this study determined if PC affected rectal temperature (Trec), body heat storage, heart rate (HR), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), thermal sensation, sweat rate, and postexercise cold-water immersion (CWI) Trec cooling rates.METHODS: In this randomized, crossover, counterbalanced study, 12 subjects (6 men, 6 women; age = 22 +/- 2 yr; mass = 73.5 +/- 7.9 kg; height = 171 +/- 7 cm) underwent 15 min of CWI (10.0 +/- 0.03 degrees C) in an environmental chamber (38.6 +/- 0.6 degrees C; 36 +/- 2% humidity). After a 10-min rest, they exercised to a Trec of 39.5 degrees C. Subsequently, they underwent CWI (9.99 +/- 0.03 degrees C) until Trec reached 38 degrees C. On control (CON) days, the same procedures occurred without the 15-min PC intervention. Trec, HR, thermal sensation, and RPE were measured at various times before, during, and after exercise.RESULTS: PC lowered body heat storage and Trec by 15.7 +/- 15.0 W . m(-2) and 0.42 +/- 0.40 degrees C, respectively, before exercise. Subjects exercised significantly longer (PC = 66.7 +/- 16.3 min, CON = 45.7 +/- 9.5 min) and at lower Trec ( approximately 0.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C) and HR ( approximately 10 +/- 7 bpm) following PC. PC significantly lowered sweat rate (PC = 1.02 +/- 0.31 L . h(-1), CON = 1.22 +/- 0.39 L . h(-1)), but did not affect RPE or CWI cooling rates (PC = 0.18 +/- 0.14 degrees C . min(-1); CON = 0.19 +/- 0.05 degrees C . min(-1)). Thermal sensation significantly differed between conditions only at pre-exercise (PC = 3 +/- 1, CON = 5 +/- 0.5).DISCUSSION: PC delayed severe hyperthermia and mitigated dehydration without affecting thermal perception or cooling rates posthyperthermia.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: We examined whether enhancing self-affirmation among a population of drinkers, prior to viewing threatening alcohol pictorial health warning labels, would reduce defensive reactions and promote reactions related to behaviour change. We also examined how health warning severity influences these reactions and whether there is an interaction between self-affirmation and severity. METHODS: In this experimental human laboratory study, participants (n = 128) were randomised to a self-affirmation or control group. After the self-affirmation manipulation was administered, we tracked participants' eye movements while they viewed images of six moderately-severe and six highly-severe pictorial health warning labels presented on large beer cans. Self-reported responses to the pictorial health warning labels were then measured, including avoidance, reactance, effectiveness, susceptibility and motivation to drink less. Finally, participants reported their self-efficacy to drink less and their alcohol use. RESULTS: There was no clear evidence that enhancing self-affirmation influenced any outcome. In comparison to moderately-severe health warnings, highly-severe health warnings increased avoidance and reactance and were perceived as more effective and increased motivation to drink less. CONCLUSIONS: These findings call into question the validity of the self-affirmation manipulation, which is purported to reduce defensive reactions to threatening warnings. We discuss possible explanations for this null effect, including the impact of participants' low perceived susceptibility to the risks shown on these pictorial health warning labels. Our finding that highly-severe health warnings increase avoidance and reactance but are also perceived as being more effective and more likely to motivate people to drink less will inform future health warning design and have implications for health warning label theory.",

    "AB": "Whey protein isolate (WPI) is high in vitamin B12 and folate. These and other related markers (holotranscobalamin, methylmalonic acid and homocysteine) have been linked with cognitive health. This study explored the efficacy of WPI for improving cognitive function via delivery of vitamin B12. Moderately vitamin B12-deficient participants aged between 45 and 75 years (n = 56) were recruited into this randomised controlled crossover trial. Participants (55% female) consumed 50 g whey (WPI; active) or soy protein isolate (SPI; control) for eight weeks. Following a 16-week washout phase, they consumed the alternative supplement. Consumption of WPI significantly improved active B12 and folate status but did not result in direct improvements in cognitive function. However, there was evidence of improvement in reaction time (p = 0.02) and reasoning speed (p = 0.04) in the SPI condition for females. Additional analyses showed that changes in active B12, HcY and folate measures during WPI treatment correlated with improvements in cognitive function (all p < 0.05). Results indicate that WPI itself did not result in improved cognitive function but some evidence of benefit of SPI for females was found. However, consistent with previous research, we present further evidence of a role for active B12, HcY and folate in supporting cognitive improvement in adults with low B vitamin status.",

    "AB": "Hops, the immature inflorescences of the female hop plant (Humulus lupulus L.) are one of the main components of beer and provides flavor and bitterness. beta-Eudesmol, an oxygenated sesquiterpene, is reported to accumulate in a particular hop cultivar. Recently, we revealed that beta-Eudesmol ingestion affected autonomic nerve activity in an animal model. The effect on humans has not been elucidated, therefore, we investigated the effects of beta-Eudesmol on reducing objective and subjective markers related to sympathetic nerve activity after the application of mental stress in healthy participants. Fifty participants (male and female aged 20 to 50 years) were randomly assigned to two groups. Five minutes before taking the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) as a mental stressor, participants in each group ingested a beverage containing beta-Eudesmol, the active beverage, or a placebo beverage that did not contain beta-Eudesmol. Saliva 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), a major product of noradrenaline breakdown and a representative marker of sympathetic nerve activity, was significantly lower just after the TSST in the active group compared with the placebo group. Saliva cortisol, a marker of the endocrine stress response system, was not significantly different between the two groups. No adverse events related to test beverage ingestion were observed. This is the first experimental evidence of beta-Eudesmol effect for mental stress in human.",

    "AB": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Polygala tenuifolia Willdenow root extract (BT-11) has beneficial effects on central nervous system disorders in human. The safety of BT-11 should be elucidated in younger person further. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the safety of BT-11 in human aged from 9 to 19 years old. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The safety was evaluated in randomly assigned subjects who received the test products (61 subjects in BT-11 300mg daily or 60 subjects in matching placebo) for 12 weeks. Adverse reactions were analyzed by the incidence rate, type, and severity. The clinical examination included hematology and blood chemistry tests, urinalysis, vital signs, body weight, and electrocardiogram (ECG). RESULTS: Eleven adverse reactions were observed in ten subjects receiving BT-11 while seven adverse reactions in six subjects receiving placebo. There were no statistical differences in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups. Serious adverse reactions such as acute appendicitis and acute viral gastroenteritis were observed in the BT-11 group4 and the placebo group, respectively. However, it was confirmed that they were not associated with the test product. All other adverse reactions observed during the test period were resolved completely without special treatment. No statistical difference was also observed in safety laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG between two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the safety of BT-11 in the adolescent by showing no apparent adverse reactions related to it.",

Methods: Chemotherapy-naive patients were randomized (1:1:1) to a single oral netupitant 30-, 100- or 300-mg dose before chemotherapy initiation. Patients received concomitant palonosetron (0.75 mg intravenously [i.v.] Day 1) and dexamethasone (9.9 mg i.v. Day 1, 8 mg orally Days 2-4). Results: Overall, 402 patients (30 mg: 134; 100 mg: 135; 300 mg: 133) were treated and evaluable for efficacy and safety. The primary endpoint of overall (0-120 h after chemotherapy administration) complete response (CR) rate (no emesis, no rescue medication) was 64.2%, 60.0% and 54.9% in the 30-, 100- and 300-mg arms, respectively, without statistical significance for dose-response. The safety profile of netupitant was comparable in the three arms. The plasma concentrations of netupitant and its metabolites increased with the dose increase from 30 mg to 300 mg. Conclusions: No dose-response relationship of netupitant in terms of overall CR rate was observed in this study. Netupitant was well tolerated at all doses without clinically harmful safety signals observed. Clinical trial registration: JapicCTI-142 483.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Among patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, combination chemotherapy with fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) leads to longer overall survival than gemcitabine therapy. We compared the efficacy and safety of a modified FOLFIRINOX regimen with gemcitabine as adjuvant therapy in patients with resected pancreatic cancer. METHODS: We randomly assigned 493 patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma to receive a modified FOLFIRINOX regimen (oxaliplatin [85 mg per square meter of body-surface area], irinotecan [180 mg per square meter, reduced to 150 mg per square meter after a protocol-specified safety analysis], leucovorin [400 mg per square meter], and fluorouracil [2400 mg per square meter] every 2 weeks) or gemcitabine (1000 mg per square meter on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks) for 24 weeks. The primary end point was disease-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival and safety. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 33.6 months, the median disease-free survival was 21.6 months in the modified-FOLFIRINOX group and 12.8 months in the gemcitabine group (stratified hazard ratio for cancer-related event, second cancer, or death, 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46 to 0.73; P<0.001). The disease-free survival rate at 3 years was 39.7% in the modified-FOLFIRINOX group and 21.4% in the gemcitabine group. The median overall survival was 54.4 months in the modified-FOLFIRINOX group and 35.0 months in the gemcitabine group (stratified hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.86; P=0.003). The overall survival rate at 3 years was 63.4% in the modified-FOLFIRINOX group and 48.6% in the gemcitabine group. Adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 75.9% of the patients in the modified-FOLFIRINOX group and in 52.9% of those in the gemcitabine group. One patient in the gemcitabine group died from toxic effects (interstitial pneumonitis). CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant therapy with a modified FOLFIRINOX regimen led to significantly longer survival than gemcitabine among patients with resected pancreatic cancer, at the expense of a higher incidence of toxic effects.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonates prevent fractures in patients with osteoporosis, but their efficacy in women with osteopenia is unknown. Most fractures in postmenopausal women occur in those with osteopenia, so therapies that are effective in women with osteopenia are needed. METHODS: We conducted a 6-year, double-blind trial involving 2000 women with osteopenia (defined by a T score of -1.0 to -2.5 at either the total hip or the femoral neck on either side) who were 65 years of age or older. Participants were randomly assigned to receive four infusions of either zoledronate at a dose of 5 mg (zoledronate group) or normal saline (placebo group) at 18-month intervals. A dietary calcium intake of 1 g per day was advised, but calcium supplements were not provided. Participants who were not already taking vitamin D supplements received cholecalciferol before the trial began (a single dose of 2.5 mg) and during the trial (1.25 mg per month). The primary end point was the time to first occurrence of a nonvertebral or vertebral fragility fracture. RESULTS: At baseline, the mean (+/-SD) age was 71+/-5 years, the T score at the femoral neck was -1.6+/-0.5, and the median 10-year risk of hip fracture was 2.3%. A fragility fracture occurred in 190 women in the placebo group and in 122 women in the zoledronate group (hazard ratio with zoledronate, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.50 to 0.79; P<0.001). The number of women that would need to be treated to prevent the occurrence of a fracture in 1 woman was 15. As compared with the placebo group, women who received zoledronate had a lower risk of nonvertebral fragility fractures (hazard ratio, 0.66; P=0.001), symptomatic fractures (hazard ratio, 0.73; P=0.003), vertebral fractures (odds ratio, 0.45; P=0.002), and height loss (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of nonvertebral or vertebral fragility fractures was significantly lower in women with osteopenia who received zoledronate than in women who received placebo.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Desmoid tumors (also referred to as aggressive fibromatosis) are connective tissue neoplasms that can arise in any anatomical location and infiltrate the mesentery, neurovascular structures, and visceral organs. There is no standard of care. METHODS: In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 87 patients with progressive, symptomatic, or recurrent desmoid tumors to receive either sorafenib (400-mg tablet once daily) or matching placebo. Crossover to the sorafenib group was permitted for patients in the placebo group who had disease progression. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival; rates of objective response and adverse events were also evaluated. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 27.2 months, the 2-year progression-free survival rate was 81% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69 to 96) in the sorafenib group and 36% (95% CI, 22 to 57) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.31; P<0.001). Before crossover, the objective response rate was 33% (95% CI, 20 to 48) in the sorafenib group and 20% (95% CI, 8 to 38) in the placebo group. The median time to an objective response among patients who had a response was 9.6 months (interquartile range, 6.6 to 16.7) in the sorafenib group and 13.3 months (interquartile range, 11.2 to 31.1) in the placebo group. The objective responses are ongoing. Among patients who received sorafenib, the most frequently reported adverse events were grade 1 or 2 events of rash (73%), fatigue (67%), hypertension (55%), and diarrhea (51%). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with progressive, refractory, or symptomatic desmoid tumors, sorafenib significantly prolonged progression-free survival and induced durable responses.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Radical prostatectomy reduces mortality among men with clinically detected localized prostate cancer, but evidence from randomized trials with long-term follow-up is sparse. METHODS: We randomly assigned 695 men with localized prostate cancer to watchful waiting or radical prostatectomy from October 1989 through February 1999 and collected follow-up data through 2017. Cumulative incidence and relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for death from any cause, death from prostate cancer, and metastasis were estimated in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, and numbers of years of life gained were estimated. We evaluated the prognostic value of histopathological measures with a Cox proportional-hazards model. RESULTS: By December 31, 2017, a total of 261 of the 347 men in the radical-prostatectomy group and 292 of the 348 men in the watchful-waiting group had died; 71 deaths in the radical-prostatectomy group and 110 in the watchful-waiting group were due to prostate cancer (relative risk, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.74; P<0.001; absolute difference in risk, 11.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.2 to 18.2). The number needed to treat to avert one death from any cause was 8.4. At 23 years, a mean of 2.9 extra years of life were gained with radical prostatectomy. Among the men who underwent radical prostatectomy, extracapsular extension was associated with a risk of death from prostate cancer that was 5 times as high as that among men without extracapsular extension, and a Gleason score higher than 7 was associated with a risk that was 10 times as high as that with a score of 6 or lower (scores range from 2 to 10, with higher scores indicating more aggressive cancer). CONCLUSIONS: Men with clinically detected, localized prostate cancer and a long life expectancy benefited from radical prostatectomy, with a mean of 2.9 years of life gained. A high Gleason score and the presence of extracapsular extension in the radical prostatectomy specimens were highly predictive of death from prostate cancer.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Primary care physicians (PCPs) working in mental health care in Tunisia often lack knowledge and skills needed to adequately address mental health-related issues. To address these lacunas, a training based on the Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) Intervention Guide (IG) was offered to PCPs working in the Greater Tunis area between February and April 2016. While the mhGAP-IG has been used extensively in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to help build non-specialists' mental health capacity, little research has focused on how contextual factors interact with the implemented training program to influence its expected outcomes. This paper's objective is to fill that lack. METHODS: We conducted a case study with a purposeful sample of 18 trained PCPs. Data was collected by semi-structured interviews between March and April 2016. Qualitative data was analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants identified more barriers than facilitators when describing contextual factors influencing the mhGAP-based training's expected outcomes. Barriers were regrouped into five categories: structural factors (e.g., policies, social context, local workforce development, and physical aspects of the environment), organizational factors (e.g., logistical issues for the provision of care and collaboration within and across healthcare organizations), provider factors (e.g., previous mental health experience and personal characteristics), patient factors (e.g., beliefs about the health system and healthcare professionals, and motivation to seek care), and innovation factors (e.g., training characteristics). These contextual factors interacted with the implemented training to influence knowledge about pharmacological treatments and symptoms of mental illness, confidence in providing treatment, negative beliefs about certain mental health conditions, and the understanding of the role of PCPs in mental health care delivery. In addition, post-training, participants still felt uncomfortable with certain aspects of treatment and the management of some mental health conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the complexity of implementing a mhGAP-based training given its interaction with contextual factors to influence the attainment of expected outcomes. Results may be used to tailor structural, organizational, provider, patient, and innovation factors prior to future implementations of the mhGAP-based training in Tunisia. Findings may also be used by decision-makers interested in implementing the mhGAP-IG training in other LMICs.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is the major cause of progressive pelvic pain and subfertility. Up to 50% of reproductive-age women suffer from pelvic pain. Endometriosis is a classic indication for IVF. Compared with women whose inability to procreate is caused by simple tubal infertility, women with endometriosis often have lower pregnancy rates following in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI). The administration of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists prior to IVF/ICSI can improve the successful pregnancy rate. Whether a briefer treatment interval would be efficacious has not been studied. METHODS/DESIGN: Eligible and consenting women will be randomly assigned to one of two treatments (one cycle of a GnRH agonist or two cycles of a GnRH agonist) prior to IVF/ICSI using a table of random numbers. The primary outcome of this trial is clinical pregnancy rate. Other outcomes include gonadotrophin (Gn) duration, the total dose of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) used, number of oocytes retrieved, number of embryos available for transfer, implantation rate, the abortion rate, live birth rate, and incidence of moderate-to-severe ovarian hyperstimulation. The sample size of this trial is estimated to be 421 participants for each of the two arms. Appropriate interim analyses will be conducted by a data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC), and the final test will be an intention-to-treat analysis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been assigned the following registry number: NCT03006406 .",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Krill powder is rich in bioactive ingredients such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), phospholipids, protein and astaxanthin. Containing dominantly EPA, it is considered to be effective in lowering lipids, foremost serum triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. Krill-derived protein hydrolysates/peptides may have positive effect on blood pressure and astaxanthin has anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, krill powder has a lot of potential in improving lipid and metabolic profile and reinforcing the activity of the antioxidant system. However, randomized clinical trials on krill powder are scarce and systematic data of krill meal on human safety is limited. Some of the earlier studies have reported several, non-serious adverse events, mostly related to gastrointestinal tract, but systematic sufficiently powered study on safety is lacking. The aim of this study was to collect data on safety and tolerability of krill powder in humans and simultaneously gain efficacy data by measuring the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. METHODS: The study was a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled intervention study with 35 overweight subjects with mildly or moderately elevated blood pressure, who took 4 g krill oil powder or 4 g of placebo during an 8-week follow-up period. The study consisted of a pre-screening, screening, day 0 baseline (randomization visit) and three follow-up visits on days 14, 28 and 56. The reported adverse events in the groups were compared as primary endpoint and haematological safety parameters and changes in systolic and diastolic pressure and blood total and lipoprotein lipids were measured as secondary end points. RESULTS: There were in total 80 reported adverse events during the follow-up; 50 in placebo and 30 in krill powder group. Gastrointestinal symptoms (flatulence, heartburn and diarrhea) were the most commonly reported among those probably related to the test products. No serious adverse events were reported. The mean value of all measured hematology variables remained within the reference values in all study subject and no significant changes were observed in blood pressure or lipid values. CONCLUSIONS: The results seem to indicate that using krill powder as a source for EPA and DHA is safe in therapeutic dose and the risk of adverse events, let alone serious ones, is low.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Unhealthy foods are promoted heavily, through food company sponsorship of elite sport, resulting in extensive exposure among young adults who are avid sport spectators. This study explores the effects of sponsorship of an elite sporting event by: (A) non-food brands (control), (B) unhealthy food brands, (C) healthier food brands, or (D) an obesity prevention public health campaign on young adults' brand awareness, attitudes, image perceptions, event-sponsor fit perceptions, and preference for food sponsors' products. METHODS: A between-subjects web-based experiment was conducted, consisting of four sponsorship conditions (A through D) featuring three product categories within each condition. Australian adults (N = 1132) aged 18-24 years were recruited via a national online panel. Participants viewed promotional videos and news stories about an upcoming international, multi-sport event (with sponsor content edited to reflect each condition), completed a distractor task, and then answered questions assessing the response variables. Regression analyses were conducted to test for differences by sponsorship condition on the respective outcome measures. RESULTS: Compared to the control condition, unhealthy food sponsorship promoted higher awareness of, and more favourable attitudes towards, unhealthy food sponsor brands. Unhealthy food sponsorship also led to greater perceived event-sponsor fit and transfer of perceptions of the sporting event to the unhealthy food sponsor brands, relative to the control group. Exposure to sponsorship for healthier foods produced similar sponsorship effects for healthier food sponsor brands, as well as prompting a significant increase in the proportion of young adults showing a preference for these products. Obesity prevention campaign sponsorship promoted higher campaign awareness and perceived event-sponsor fit, but did not impact food attitudes or preference for unhealthy versus healthier foods. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that restricting elite sport sponsorship to healthier food brands that meet set nutritional criteria could help promote healthier eating among young adults. Sporting organisations should be encouraged to seek sponsorship from companies who produce healthier food brands and government-funded social marketing campaigns.

Before treatment, 2 weeks and 1 month after treatment, the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM), modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) of the hamstrings and triceps, plantar area and plantar pressure were examined for efficacy assessment.A total of 82 children with spastic cerebral palsy were recruited, including 43 children in treatment group and 39 children in control group. There was no significant difference in the age, MAS score, and GMFM score between the 2 groups before treatment. There were statistically significant differences between the 2 groups at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after treatment, including the MAS score, GMFM score, plantar area and plantar pressure (P < .05). Within groups, there were also significant differences at different times (P < .05).The rESWT combined with rehabilitation can quickly and effectively relieve paralysis of lower extremities, reduce the tension of hamstrings and calf muscles, relieve muscle spasm, and rapidly improve limb function in children with spastic cerebral palsy.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Medical researchers have been reluctant to use neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBD) during the use of intraoperative motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring despite the possibility of patient movement. In this study, we compared the effects of no NMBD and continuous rocuronium infusion on the incidence of patient involuntary movement and MEP monitoring. METHODS: In this study, 80 patients who underwent neuro intervention with MEP monitoring were randomly assigned into 2 groups. After an anesthetic induction, bolus of rocuronium 0.1 mg/kg was injected when it was needed (for patient involuntary movement or at the request of the surgeon) in group B, and 5 mcg/kg/min of rocuronium were infused in group I study participants. The incidence of patient involuntary movement and spontaneous respiration, the mean MEP amplitude, coefficient of variation (CV), the incidence of MEP stimulus change and train-of-four (TOF) count were compared. RESULTS: The incidence of involuntary movement and spontaneous movement were measured as significantly lower in group I (P < .05). The incidence of undetectable MEP did not differ as measured in both groups. The means and CVs of MEP amplitude in all limbs were significantly lower in group I. The mean TOF counts from 30 to 80 min of operation were significantly higher in group B. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the continuous infusion of rocuronium effectively inhibited the involuntary movement and spontaneous respiration of the patient while enabling MEP monitoring.",

The aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic benefits of soft non-manipulative osteopathic techniques in patients with CD. METHODS: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was performed. 30 individuals with CD were divided into 2 groups: 16 in the experimental group (EG) and 14 in the control group (CG). The intervention period lasted 30 days (1 session every 10 days). Pain, global quality of life (GQoL) and QoL specific for CD (QoLCD) were assessed before and after the intervention. Anxiety and depression levels were measured at the beginning of the study. RESULTS: We observed a significant effect of the treatment in both the physical and task subscales of the GQoL (P = .01 and P = .04, respectively) and also in the QoLCD (P </=.0001) but not in pain score (P = .28). When the intensity of pain was taken into consideration in the analysis of the EG, there was a significantly greater increment in the QoLCD after treatment in people without pain than in those with pain (P = .02) The improvements in GQoL were independent from the disease status (P = .16). CONCLUSIONS: Soft, non-manipulative osteopathic treatment is effective in improving overall and physical-related QoL in CD patients, regardless of the phase of the disease. Pain is an important factor that inversely correlates with the improvements in QoL.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUPD: This study investigated the plasma fentanyl concentration and efficacy of transdermal fentanyl patch (TFP) (25 mug/h) in the management of acute postoperative pain. METHODS: Patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly allocated to 2 groups. The TFP group (n = 30) received a single TFP 25 mug/ h to the anterior chest wall 14 h before operation. The IV group (n = 30) received a placebo patch. After the operation, intravenous fentanyl infusion (25 mug/h) was begun with loading dose 25 mug in the IV group and only normal saline in the TFP group. Plasma fentanyl levels were measured at admission, 1, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h postoperatively. Pain severity and adverse effects were evaluated too. RESULTS: The fentanyl level peaked 1 h after operation in the TFP group (3.27 +/- 0.34 ng/mL) and 24 h postoperatively in the IV group (2.9 +/- 0.42 ng/mL). Pain scores and the use of rescue analgesics were not significantly different between 2 groups. Respiratory depression was not happened in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The TFP (25 mug/h) affixed 14 h before surgery reached a higher constant concentration than the same dose setting of a constant IV infusion of fentanyl after surgery. Although the concentration of fentanyl was higher than those of previous researches, there was no respiratory depression. But, there was no advantage of reducing pain score and the use of rescue analgesics. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: (available at: http://cris.nih.go.kr, KCT0002221).",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Few studies have been conducted on the utility of cervical spine phantoms for practicing cervical procedures. Here, we describe a simple method for creating a cervical spine phantom and investigate whether the use of a gelatin-based phantom is associated with improved proficiency in performing ultrasound-guided cervical medial branch block. METHODS: A cervical spine phantom was prepared using a cervical spine model immersed in a mixture of gelatin and psyllium husk. In total, 27 participants, inexperienced in spinal ultrasonography, were enrolled and allocated to 1 of 2 groups (training group, n = 18; control group, n = 9). All participants were tested (test-1) following an introductory course of basic ultrasonography. Participants in the control group were tested again after 1 week (test-2). Those in the training group received a further individual 3-hour training session, and were tested again after 1 week (test-2). RESULTS: The mean performance score in test-1 was 62.5 +/- 10.1 points in the training group and 62.3 +/- 4.1 points in the control group [95% confidence interval (95% CI) -5.5 to 5.8; P = .954]. In test-2, the mean score was 86.8 +/- 6.5 points and 59.9 +/- 4.4 points in the training and control groups, respectively (95% CI 21.9-31.8; P < .001). The mean time required to complete test-1 was 84.6 +/- 26.6 seconds in training group and 90.7 +/- 43.9 seconds in the control group (95% CI -34.0 to 21.7; P = .653); in test-2, the time required was 56.6 +/- 27.9 and 91.2 +/- 43.8 seconds (95% CI -63.0 to -6.2; P = .019), respectively. Interobserver reliability showed excellent agreement based on the intraclass correlation coefficient, and moderate to almost perfect agreement by kappa statistics. CONCLUSION: Training using a gelatin-based cervical spine phantom helps novices acquire the skills necessary to perform ultrasound-guided cervical medial branch blocks.",

    "AB": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative celecoxib administration in alleviating postoperative pain in knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).A total of 226 knee OA patients underwent TKA were consecutively recruited and randomized into preoperative analgesia group and postoperative analgesia group as 1:1 ratio. Preoperative analgesia group received celecoxib before and post operation; postoperative analgesia group received celecoxib post operation, all patients received TKA and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) post operation. Pain visual analog scale (VAS), patient's global assessment (PGA), flexional angles, PCA consumption, percentage of patients receiving pethidine, pethidine consumption, and adverse events were assessed.Pain VAS scores at rest and at flexion were both lower in preoperative analgesia group compared to postoperative analgesia group at 2 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours post operation. Preoperative analgesia group also exhibited decreased PGA score compared to postoperative analgesia group at 2 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours post operation. Meanwhile, active flexional angle and passive flexional angle in preoperative analgesia group were larger than that in postoperative analgesia group at 72 hours post operation. More interestingly, preoperative analgesia group patients consumed less PCA compared to postoperative analgesia group patients at 72 hours post operation. No difference of adverse event incidences between 2 groups was observed.Preoperative administration of celecoxib exhibits better efficacy and equal safety profiles compared to postoperative administration of celecoxib in knee OA patients undergoing TKA.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: To investigate the effectiveness of Baduanjin qigong combined with cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) on the physical fitness and psychological health of elderly housebound. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 120 elderly housebound were randomly divided into 3 intervention groups: Baduanjin training, Baduanjin training combined with CBT, and CBT. The interventions were conducted by means of home visits over 6 months. Spirometry, SF-36 health survey of quality of life, and Lawton and Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL) were used to collect physical health data, and self-evaluation of overall health status, self-evaluation of loneliness, and short-form geriatric depression scale (GDS-15) were used to collect mental health data at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months after intervention. Data was analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance (rANOVA) and chi-squared test (chi test). RESULTS: Forced vital capacity (FVC), maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), quality of life (QOL), and self-reported health status were significantly increased (P < .05) in the group receiving joint Baduanjin and CBT intervention at 3 months and 6 months, as compared to the Baduanjin only group or the CBT only group. Activities of daily living (ADL), self-evaluated loneliness, and level of depression were significantly lowered (P < .05) in the group receiving joint Baduanjin and CBT intervention at 3 months and 6 months, as compared to the Baduanjin only group or the CBT only group. CONCLUSIONS: Physical and psychological statuses of elderly housebound were significantly improved by Baduanjin training combined with CBT. The effect of the combined intervention exceeded that of CBT or Baduanjin alone.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of nerve electrical stimulation (NES) for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC). METHODS: One hundred twenty-four eligible patients with AGC were included in this randomized controlled trial. They were equally divided the NES group and the sham group. The patients in the NES group received NES intervention, while the subjects in the sham group underwent sham NES. The primary outcome included symptoms severity and appetite. The secondary outcomes included quality of life, as measured by the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) score, and functional impairment, as evaluated by the Karnofsky score. Additionally, adverse events were also documented during the period of the treatment. RESULTS: After treatment, NES showed greater effectiveness in reducing the severity of nausea (P = .02), and vomiting (P = .04), as well as the appetite improvement (P = .02), compared with the sham NES. Furthermore, no adverse events related to NES treatment were detected. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated that NES may help to relieve CINV in patients with AGC. Future studies are still needed to warrant these results.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: To compare the superiority of teaching methods for acquiring a proficient level of surgical skill in a robotic surgery-naive individual using a robotic virtual reality simulator. METHODS: This study employed a prospective, randomized study design to assess student's learning curve. We divided 45 subjects into 3 groups: those with expert proctoring (group I), those who watched only an educational video (group II), and those with independent training (group III; n = 15 per group). The task used in this study was the Tube 2 and it imitates a vesicourethral anastomosis in robotic prostatectomy. The effects were analyzed by the time to end the task after overcoming the learning curve which is determined by several performance parameters. RESULTS: The number of task repetitions required to reach the learning curve plateau was 45, 42, and 37 repetitions in groups I, II, and III, which means that there was continuous improvement in performing the task after 40 repetitions only in groups I and II. The mean time for completing the task during the stabilization period was significantly different between group I and group III and group II and group III, which means that the independent training method was inferior to the other methods (group I vs. group II vs. group III: 187.38 vs. 187.07 vs. 253.47 seconds, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: This study's findings showed that an educational video can be as beneficial as expert proctoring, which implies that the development of a standardized educational video would be worthwhile.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Today, the ever-expanding technology is inevitably shadowing on all aspects of human life. This study was aimed to compare the prophylactic effects of paracetamol and dexmedetomidine for controlling hemodynamics during surgery and postoperative pain. METHODS: The study population consisted of 132 patients aged 18 to 70 years and from both genders, who were candidates for emergency cholecystectomy or elective surgery. Group A consisted of 66 patients who received dexmedetomidine, and Group B included 66 patients with paracetamol administration. The amount of postoperative pain was measured on the basis of visual analog scale, arterial blood pressure, as well as heart rate at recovery and 4, 12, and 24 hours after surgery. RESULTS: The mean age in the 2 groups was similar and almost equal to 52 years; there was no difference in the sex ratios in both groups (P > .05). Pain score in the paracetamol group was significantly lower than that in the dexmedetomidine group (P = .04); nevertheless, there were no group differences in the mean scores of pain during these hours (P > .05). The median opioid use in 24 hours after operation in the paracetamol group was lower when compared with that in the dexmedetomidine group, and the mean duration of analgesia in the paracetamol group was higher when comparing with dexmedetomidine group. Furthermore, in both groups, mean arterial pressure and preoperative PR interval were similar at various times. CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrated that both regimens of drugs can control the hemodynamic status of patients during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which provides effective postoperative analgesia for pain management.",

The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of intervention of intensive education on hand hygiene on HFMD.We randomized 64 villages into intervention and control groups in Handan, Hebei province, China. Parents and caregivers of children 6 to 40 months age group in intervention villages received intensive education on hand hygiene. Control group received general education. The intervention period was from April 1 to July 31, 2011 and April 1 to July 31, 2012. We measured and compare the knowledge and incidences of HFMD between 2 groups.We collected 6484 questionnaires, including 3583 in the intervention group [response rate: 96% (3583/3726)] and 2901 in the control group [response rate: 90% (2901/3224)]. We observed that hand washing habit of children and parent, knowledge of HFMD of parents, children's daily cleaning habits scores improved in the intervention group and higher than that in the control group at both the end of year 1 (April 1-July 31, 2011)and year 2 (April 1-July 31, 2012). The incidence of HFMD (2.1%) in intervention group was significantly lower than that in control group (4.2%) at year 2 (chi = 22.138, P <.001). The positive percent of coli-form on the hand swabs in intervention group (2.00%) were significantly lower than that in control group (9.45%) at the end of year 2.The intervention of intensive education on hand hygiene effectively improved the personal hygiene both of children and parents, as well as reduced the incidence of HFMD. We suggested expanding the intervention measures in community to prevent HFMD.",

Methods: A random cluster sampling method has been used, including 300 rural residents aged above 18 years old from three villages (184 in control group, 116 in intervention group), in order to proceed the physical check-up and health education programs. Unchanged rate, transfer rate of patients, rate of impaired glucose tolerance, turn normal rate and other biochemical indicators of patients and people with impaired glucose tolerance from control group and intervention group were analyzed, to evaluate the intervention effects of peer support education mode. Results: The glycemic control rate of intervention group for patients and people with impaired glucose tolerance (72.2% and 71.4%) were higher than control group (43.6% and 26.7%), but the unchanged rate of intervention group (13.9% and 0.0%) were lower than control group (42.3% and 73.3%). Patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance in the education group improved significantly in waist-to-hip ratio, uric acid, total cholesterol and HDL-C. Glycemic hemoglobin level also improved significantly in diabetes patients of the education group. Conclusion: Peer support for education intervention seemed beneficial for diabetic control. The combination of education and effect evaluation was important in the evaluation of diabetes prevention and control. Peer support education also benefited the blood glucose control in general population.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Compare the outcome of spinal deformity correction between Ti-Ti and CrCo-Ti rods for the treatment of spinal Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) using rods mentioned with all pedicle screws and translation technique. METHOD: 59 patients operated for spinal deformity (Lenke 1 or 2) AIS. The patients were divided into two groups by random allocation using Ti-Ti rods (n = 29) and CrCo-Ti rods (n = 30) and the alone difference among them in the surgical procedure was rod material (Ti-Ti or CrCo-Ti rods) and finally, radiological outcomes were compared preoperatively, postoperatively and at last follow-up for 12 months. RESULTS: Patients' main curve correction after surgical procedure regardless type of rod was 48.95+/-11.04 (13-75) degree. Success rate of spinal deformity correction following surgical procedure regardless of type of administered rod was 86.76 +/- 11.30 percent (62.5-100%). Mean of deformity correction rate was 91.49+/-10.67% using CrCo-Ti rods versus 81.86+/-9.88% using Ti-Ti rods (P-value=0.01). Angle change was 3.29+/-6.60 for kyphosis angle and 0.59+/-7.76 for lordosis angle. Rate of main curve correction was not significantly different considering patients' gender (P-value0.657). Main curve correction success rate was in association with patients' age and type of rod (P-value=0.054, r=-1.863 and P-value=0.001, r=8.865 respectively). CONCLUSION: CrCo-Ti rods have the ability to produce higher correction rates in AIS compared to Ti-Ti rod of the same diameter. CrCo-Ti rods provide significant and stable spinal correction, especially in correction of main curve. This rate was associated with patients' age and type of rod administered but not gender.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To reduce the inappropriate identification of eye drops, through the use of different colors. METHODS: A group of 34 healthy volunteers was presented to two groups of four eye drops each. All eye drops were placed in identical, unlabelled vials. In one group, all four eye drops were transparent. In the other group, each had a different color. A number was assigned to each eye drop, and the volunteer was asked to identify it by color. We measured the correct index in the identification of the eye drops of the two groups. RESULTS: The volunteers had a level of education from incomplete junior school to complete graduate course, with 16 males (48%) and 18 females (52%), age range of 21 to 87 years. The success rate in the group of colored eye drops was 88% and, in the group of transparent, 24%. CONCLUSION: The use of colorings in eye drops can help distinguishing the vials and preventing misidentification.",

    "AB": "Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of SuperPATH approach in total hip arthroplasty (THA) compared with conventional posterolateral approach. Methods: Between March 2017 and May 2017, 24 patients who planned to have a unilateral THA were enrolled in the study and randomized into 2 groups. Twelve patients were treated with SuperPATH approach (SuperPATH group) and 12 patients with posterolateral approach (control group). There was no significant difference in gender, age, body mass index, the type of disease, complicating diseases, and American Society of Anesthesiologists grading between 2 groups ( P>0.05). The operation time, length of stay, length of incision, and perioperative complications related to operation were recorded. The hemoglobin and hematocrit were recorded; the total blood loss and intraoperative blood loss were calculated. The inflammatory response indicators (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and muscle damage index (creatine kinase) were recorded in both groups. The range of motion, functional score (Harris score), visual analogue scale (VAS) score, and prosthesis position were recorded. Results: Patients in both groups were followed up 1 year. Compared with the control group, the operation time of the SuperPATH group was longer ( t=4.470, P=0.000), and the incision was shorter ( t=-2.168, P=0.041). There was no significant difference in length of stay between 2 groups ( t=0.474, P=0.640). Periprosthetic fracture occurred in 1 case of the SuperPATH group. No other complications, such as infection or deep vein thrombosis, occurred in both groups. There was no significant difference in intraoperative blood loss, total blood loss, hemoglobin and hematocrit before operation and at 1 and 3 days after operation, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate before operation and at 1, 3, and 14 days between 2 groups ( P>0.05). For creatine kinase, SuperPATH group at 1 and 3 days were lower than control group ( P<0.05), while no significant difference was found between 2 groups before operation and at 14 days after operation ( P>0.05). For flexion and abduction activity, SuperPATH group at 1 and 3 days after operation were better than the control group ( P<0.05), while no significant difference was found between 2 groups at 14 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after operation ( P>0.05). The Harris and VAS scores of SuperPATH group at 1 and 3 days after operation were better than those of control group ( P<0.05). There was no significant difference in anteversion and abduction between 2 groups ( P>0.05) according to the X-ray film at 1 year. During the follow-up, no loosening or migration was observed. Conclusion: Compared with the posterolateral approach, the SuperPATH approach can reduce muscle damage, relieve early pain, promote recovery, and obtain the similar short-term effectiveness.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a common sequelae of severe combat-related emotional trauma that is often associated with significantly reduced quality of life in afflicted veterans. To date, no published study has examined the effect of an active, music-instruction intervention as a complementary strategy to improve the psychological well-being of veterans with PTSD. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and potential effectiveness of an active, music-instruction intervention in improving psychological health and social functioning among Veterans suffering from moderate to severe PTSD. METHODS: The study was designed as a prospective, delayed-entry randomized pilot trial. Regression-adjusted difference in means were used to examine the intervention's effectiveness with respect to PTSD symptomatology (primary outcome) as well as depression, perceptions of cognitive failures, social functioning and isolation, and health-related quality of life (secondary outcomes). RESULTS: Of the 68 Veterans who were self- or provider-referred to the program, 25 (36.7%) were ineligible due to (i) absence of a PTSD diagnosis (n = 3); participation in ongoing intense psychotherapy (n = 4) or inpatient substance abuse program (n = 2); current resident of the Domiciliary (n = 8) and inability to participate due to distance of residence from the VA (n = 8). Only 3 (4.4%) Veterans declined participation due to lack of interest. The mean age of enrolled subjects was 51 years old [range: 22 to 76]. The majority was male (90%). One-quarter were African American or Black. While 30% report working full or part time, 45% were retired due to disability. Slightly over one-quarter were veterans of the OEF/OIF wars. Estimates from regression-adjusted treatment effects indicate that the average PTSD severity score was reduced by 9.7 points (p = 0.01), or 14.3% from pre- to post-intervention. Similarly, adjusted depressive symptoms were reduced by 20.4% (- 6.3 points, p = 0.02). There were no statistically significant regression-adjusted effects on other outcomes, although the direction of change was consistent with improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the active, music-instruction program holds promise as a complementary means of ameliorating PTSD and depressive symptoms among this population.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Riociguat is a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTPEH). The objective of this study was to evaluate right heart size and function assessed by echocardiography during long term treatment with riociguat. METHODS: Patients who started riociguat treatment (1.0-2.5 mg tid) within the trials phase II, PATENT, PATENTplus, EAS, CHEST and continued treatment for 3-12 months were included in this study. Echocardiography was analysed off-line at baseline, after 3, 6 and 12 months by investigators who were blinded to clinical data. Last and baseline observation carried forward method (LOCF, BOCF) were performed as sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients (45% PAH, 55% CTEPH; 53.5% female; 60 +/- 13 years, mean pulmonary arterial pressure 46 +/- 10 mmHg, mean PVR 700 +/- 282dynes.sec.cm-5) were included. After 6 months, RA and RV area, RV thickness tricuspid regurgitation velocity showed a significant reduction. After 12 months, patients receiving riociguat therapy showed a significant reduction in right atrial (- 2.6 +/- 4.4 cm2, 95% CI -3.84, - 1.33; p < 0.001, n = 49) and right ventricular (RV) area (- 3.5 +/- 5.2 cm2, 95% CI -5.1, - 1.9; p < 0.001; n = 44), RV thickness (- 0.76 +/- 2.2 mm, 95% CI -1.55, 0.03; n = 32), and a significant increase in TAPSE (2.95 +/- 4.78 mm, 95% CI 1.52, 4.39; n = 45) and RV fractional area change (8.12 +/- 8.87 mm, 95% CI 4.61, 11.62; n = 27). Both LOCF and BOCF showed similar results but lower effect sizes. CONCLUSION: Patients under long-term treatment with riociguat show significantly reduced right heart size and improved RV function in PAH and CTEPH. Further controlled prospective studies are needed to confirm these results.",

    "AB": "Introduction: Research from Philip Morris International's science division on its Heat-not-Burn product IQOS(TM) focused on its chemical, toxicological, clinical, and behavioral aspects. Independent research on the experiences and behavioral aspects of using IQOS(TM), and how it compares to e-cigarettes, is largely lacking. The current randomized, cross-over behavioral trial tried to bridge the latter gaps. Methods: Participants (n = 30) came to the lab on three consecutive days after being overnight smoking abstinent. During each session, participants used one of three products (cigarette, e-cigarette, or IQOS(TM)) for five minutes. Exhaled CO (eCO) measurements and questionnaires were repeatedly administered throughout the session. Results: Smoking a cigarette for five minutes resulted in a significant increase of eCO, whereas using an IQOS(TM) resulted in a small but reliable increase (0.3 ppm). Vaping did not affect eCO. Cigarette craving reduced significantly after product use, with the decline being stronger for smoking than for e-cigarettes or IQOS(TM). Withdrawal symptoms declined immediately after smoking or using IQOS(TM), and with some delay after vaping. IQOS(TM) scored higher in terms of subjective reward/satisfaction and was slightly preferred to the e-cigarette. Discussion: Short-term use of IQOS(TM) has a minimal impact on eCO, is equally effective in reducing cigarette craving and withdrawal symptoms as an e-cigarette, and is slightly preferred.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this analysis was to ascertain the type of relationship between fish and seafood consumption, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFA) intake, and depression prevalence. METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses of the PREDIMED-Plus trial. Fish and seafood consumption and omega-3 PUFA intake were assessed through a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Self-reported life-time medical diagnosis of depression or use of antidepressants was considered as outcome. Depressive symptoms were collected by the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between seafood products and omega-3 PUFA consumption and depression. Multiple linear regression models were fitted to assess the association between fish and long-chain (LC) omega-3 PUFA intake and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Out of 6587 participants, there were 1367 cases of depression. Total seafood consumption was not associated with depression. The odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence intervals (CIs)) for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quintiles of consumption of fatty fish were 0.77 (0.63(-)0.94), 0.71 (0.58(-)0.87), and 0.78 (0.64(-)0.96), respectively, and p for trend = 0.759. Moderate intake of total LC omega-3 PUFA (approximately 0.5(-)1 g/day) was significantly associated with a lower prevalence of depression. CONCLUSION: In our study, moderate fish and LC omega-3 PUFA intake, but not high intake, was associated with lower odds of depression suggesting a U-shaped relationship.",

    "AB": "PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Interventions for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be inadequate for some patients. There is evidence that supplementation with L-methylfolate augments antidepressant agent effects and thus might also augment ADHD treatment effects by a common catecholaminergic mechanism. METHODS: Forty-four adults with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition diagnosis of ADHD participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial of 15 mg of L-methylfolate in combination with osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate. Osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate was dose optimized over the first 6 weeks. We evaluated the effects on ADHD symptoms, self-report on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function of executive function, methylphenidate dosing, neuropsychological test measures, the Adult ADHD Self-report scale, emotional dysregulation, social adjustment, and work productivity, as well as moderating effects of body mass index, autoantibodies to folate receptors, and select genetic polymorphisms. RESULTS: L-Methylfolate was well tolerated, with no significant effect over placebo except improvement from abnormal measures on the mean adaptive dimension of the ASR scale (chi = 4.36, P = 0.04). Methylphenidate dosing was significantly higher in individuals on L-methylfolate over time (chi = 7.35, P = 0.007). Exploratory analyses suggested that variation in a guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase gene predicted association with higher doses of methylphenidate (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: L-Methylfolate was associated with no change in efficacy on measures relevant to neuropsychiatric function in adults with ADHD, other than suggestion of reduced efficacy of methylphenidate. Further investigation would be required to confirm this effect and its mechanism and the genotype prediction of effects on dosing.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: beta-alanine (betaA) supplementation has been shown to increase intramuscular carnosine content and subsequent high-intensity performance in events lasting < 4 minutes (min), which may be dependent on total, as opposed to daily, dose. The ergogenic effect of betaA has also been demonstrated for 2000-m rowing performance prompting interest in whether betaA may be beneficial for sustained aerobic exercise. This study therefore investigated the effect of two betaA dosing strategies on 30-min rowing and subsequent sprint performance. METHODS: Following University Ethics approval, twenty-seven healthy, male rowers (age: 24 +/- 2 years; body-height: 1.81 +/- 0.02 m; body-mass: 82.3 +/- 2.5 kg; body-fat: 14.2 +/- 1.0%) were randomised in a double-blind manner to 4 weeks of: i) betaA (2.4 g.d(- 1), betaA1); ii) matched total betaA (4.8 g on alternate days, betaA2); or iii) cornflour placebo (2.4 g.d(- 1), PL). Participants completed a laboratory 30-min rowing time-trial, followed by 3x30-seconds (s) maximal sprint efforts at days 0, 14 and 28 (T1-T3). Total distance (m), average power (W), relative average power (W.kg(- 1)), cardio-respiratory measures and perceived exertion were assessed for each 10-min split. Blood lactate ([La-]b mmol.L(- 1)) was monitored pre-post time-trial and following maximal sprint efforts. A 3-way repeated measures ANOVA was employed for main analyses, with Bonferonni post-hoc assessment (P </= 0.05). RESULTS: Total 30-min time-trial distance significantly increased from T1-T3 within betaA1 only (7397 +/- 195 m to 7580 +/- 171 m, P = 0.002, np(2) = 0.196), including absolute average power (194.8 +/- 18.3 W to 204.2 +/- 15.5 W, P = 0.04, np(2) = 0.115) and relative average power output (2.28 +/- 0.15 W.kg(- 1) to 2.41 +/- 0.12 W.kg(- 1), P = 0.031, np(2) = 0.122). These findings were potentially explained by within-group significance for the same variables for the first 10 min split (P </= 0.01), and for distance covered (P = 0.01) in the second 10-min split. However, no condition x time interactions were observed. No significant effects were found for sprint variables (P > 0.05) with comparable values at T3 for mean distance (betaA1: 163.9 +/- 3.8 m; betaA2: 161.2 +/- 3.5 m; PL: 162.7 +/- 3.6 m), average power (betaA1: 352.7 +/- 14.5 W; betaA2: 342.2 +/- 13.5 W; PL: 348.2 +/- 13.9 W) and lactate (betaA1: 10.0 +/- 0.9 mmol.L(- 1); betaA2: 9.2 +/- 1.1 mmol.L(- 1); PL: 8.7 +/- 0.9 mmol.L(- 1)). CONCLUSIONS: Whilst daily betaA may confer individual benefits, these results demonstrate limited impact of betaA (irrespective of dosing strategy) on 30-min rowing or subsequent sprint performance. Further investigation of betaA dosage > 2.4 g.d(- 1) and/or chronic intervention periods (> 4-8 weeks) may be warranted based on within-group observations.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Schools have been identified as key environments to promote child physical activity (PA). Implementation of multi-component PA interventions within schools is advocated but research has showed that they may not always be effective at increasing child PA. Results of the Active Schools: Skelmersdale (AS:Sk) multi-component pilot intervention indicated no significant positive change to child PA levels. Process evaluations can provide information on which aspects of an intervention were delivered and how. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to use a combination of methods to elicit child and teacher perceptions regarding the feasibility and acceptability of the AS:Sk intervention, alongside systematic researcher observations. The overarching study aim was to understand how schools implemented the AS:Sk intervention, with a specific focus on the frequency of intervention component implementation, and how the components were incorporated into the school day. METHODS: The study generated five data sets. Data elicited from 18 participating children via a write draw, show and tell task included, frequency counts of most enjoyable intervention components, drawings, and verbatim data. Teacher verbatim data was collected from 3 interviews, and 18 researcher observations were recorded using field notes. The data sources were pooled to produce the themes presented in the results section. RESULTS: The combination of data sources revealed four themes and 16 sub-themes. Implementation methods: how and when the components were implemented in schools. Child engagement: enjoyment and positive behaviour. Facilitators: peer influence, teacher influence, staggered implementation, incentives, rewards, challenges and competition, flexibility and adaptability, child ownership, routine. Barriers: time within an intense curriculum, space, sustaining child interest, parental support, school policies. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that teachers believed classroom based activities were most feasible and acceptable due to the reduced implementation barriers of sufficient time and space. In contrast, children reported that the activities outside of the classroom were preferred. Future school-based PA interventions should aim to achieve a balance between routine PA at a set time and PA that is flexible and adaptable. Further process evaluations of multi-component school-based PA interventions are warranted to develop the limited evidence base.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Health promotion programs can only lead to improvements in health outcomes if they are effectively implemented. However, most studies assessing implementation success focus on only one condition, although more conditions influence this process. Therefore, evidence is scarce on what conditions play a role in successful implementation and how they interact. Hence, we aimed to identify which combinations of teacher and implementation process characteristics affected the emotional and social school experience (SCE) of pupils participating in a school-based health promotion program. METHODS: This study was part of an effectiveness and process evaluation including 24 intervention and 27 control classes. We used fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify combinations of conditions that were associated with either an increase or no increase in the outcome SCE in comparison to the control group at 20 months post intervention. We deductively selected five conditions based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research: teachers' perceived self-efficacy, teachers' expectations of the benefits of the intervention, teachers' previous knowledge about the intervention, dosage of physical activity breaks, and quality of the implementation. RESULTS: We identified five different pathways that led to no increase in the pupils' outcome (parameters of fit: consistency 94%, coverage 66%). The combination of an unsatisfying quality of implementing the intervention and a low previous knowledge about the intervention showed the highest empirical relevance. Similarly, fewer physical activity breaks in combination with other conditions impeded the program's success. Furthermore, we identified two different pathways characterizing ways to success (consistency: 81%, coverage: 52%). The most relevant combination was good quality implementation of physical activity breaks, implemented by teachers with a high self-efficacy, and a good previous knowledge about the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: QCA has potential for an in-depth analysis of complex interventions as it can rely on small to medium sample sizes and analyze pathways to success and non-success separately. The investigated program can be improved by considering the following suggestions: The quality of the implementation process should be monitored during the implementation phase, and regular feedback loops and learning opportunities for teachers should accompany a program. Clear recommendations regarding the dosage should be established. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German register of clinical studies: DRKS00000622 .

    "AB": "Vitamin D is involved in bone metabolism and in many various extra-skeletal diseases such as malabsorption syndromes, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, cancer, and autoimmune and neurological diseases. However, data on the optimal route of administration are not consistent. The aims of our study were to analyze not only the influence of daily vs. monthly administration of vitamin D on bone metabolism and bone turnover, but also the effects of different routes of administration on fat mass in a cohort of adults with low levels of 25(OH) vitamin D3 at baseline. We analyzed 44 patients with hypovitaminosis at baseline and after six months of two different regimens of administration: seven drops (1750 IU)/day vs. 50,000 IU/month. We found that the two regimens were equivalent; 36 out of 44 patients reached the normal range of vitamin D after six months of treatment. Interestingly, the main determinant of vitamin D at baseline was the waist circumference. In addition, 22 patients treated by monthly regimen were evaluated after 18 months of treatment. At the end of follow-up, patients showed normal levels of vitamin D, with increased calcium levels and decreased bone turnover. Waist circumference also decreased. Our results support the efficacy of vitamin D3 given monthly both for correcting hypovitaminosis and for maintaining vitamin D levels. The relationship between serum 25(OH)vitamin D3 concentration and waist circumference supports vitamin D having a protective role in the current setting, since waist size is directly associated with the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the preoperative sedation, the status of separation from parents, compliance with the mask, hemodynamic parameters and postoperative agitation of intranasal dexmedetomidine (DEX) premedication on children undergoing dental rehabilitation under general anesthesia. METHODS: In the study, 60 children of American Society of Anesthesiology classification (ASA I-II), aged 2-9 years, were randomly assigned to one of two equal groups. Thirty minutes before operation, control group received intranasal placebo (0.9% saline) 0.02 mL/kg, and DEX group received intranasal DEX 2 mug/kg. The preoperative sedation score, the status of separation from parents, compliance with the mask and hemodynamic parameters were recorded by an anesthesiologists until anesthesia induction. Recovery conditions, postoperative agitation were also recorded. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups in patient characteristics, operation time, extubation time and recovery time. Compared with the children in control group, those in DEX group were significantly more sedated when they were separated from their parents (56.7% vs. 26.7%, P<0.05). Satisfactory compliance with mask application was 40% in control group vs. 73.3% in DEX group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the incidences of postoperative agitation and oxygen saturation (SpO2). Compared with control group, the heart rate (HR) of DEX group was decreased after 20 minutes of drug administration [(97.13+/-12.93) beats/min vs.(104.53+/-11.97) beats/min, P<0.05]. The changes of the HR and SpO2 in the two groups were within the normal range. There were no incidences of bradycardia and hypoxemia in either of the groups during study observation. CONCLUSION: Premedication with intranasal DEX 2 mug/kg for children undergoing dental rehabilitation under general anesthesia produces good preoperative sedation. The levels of sedation, scores of parental separation and compliance with the mask were satisfied. The children have good recovery conditions, and no obvious postoperative agitation and respiratory depression after DEX administration. Intranasal DEX 2 mug/kg is an effective and safe alternative for premedication in children.",

Changes in unilateral upper limb muscular strength and Electroymographic activity after a 16-week strength training intervention in survivors of breast cancer. J Strength Cond Res 33(1): 225-233, 2019-Upper limb strength deficits are frequently observed following breast cancer (BC) and its treatments. It is currently unknown whether these unilateral deficits can be corrected by a standard bilateral strength training intervention. Twenty-three survivors of BC were included in this analysis. Fourteen performed a 16-week resistance training (RT) intervention, 9 were assigned to a usual care waitlist control group. Electromyographic analysis of the pectoralis major and triceps brachii were monitored during 3 maximal isometric contractions and a fatiguing endurance task. Muscular strength was significantly different between limbs at the start of the intervention (p = 0.02). Electromyographic amplitude and median frequency did not differ between limbs at the start of the intervention. Muscular strength was significantly different between limbs in the RT group at the end of the intervention (p = 0.01). Electromyographic amplitude did not differ between limbs or groups at the end of the intervention. Bilateral strength training did not correct the unilateral strength deficit observed in this group of survivors of breast cancer. Periods of unilateral strength training should be implemented into periodized RT programs in this cohort.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVES: To compare the effect of toric versus spherical soft contact lenses on objective measures of visual performance using visual acuity and electromyography of the orbicularis oculi muscle. METHODS: Current soft contact lens wearers with -0.75 to -1.75 D astigmatism in each eye were binocularly fitted with toric (1-Day ACUVUE MOIST for astigmatism) and spherical (1-Day ACUVUE MOIST) contact lenses in random order. After each fitting and at 1-week follow-up, high- and low-contrast visual acuities were measured. Electromyography was used to objectively evaluate eyestrain. Linear mixed models were used to assess differences between toric and spherical contact lenses. RESULTS: The mean age (+/-SD) of the 60 participants was 27.5+/-5.0 years, spherical refractive error was -3.68+/-2.01 D, and cylinder was -1.28+/-0.36 D. High- and low-contrast visual acuities with toric lenses were better than with spherical lenses at both fitting (toric high-contrast: -0.065+/-0.078 and low-contrast: 0.133+/-0.103 vs. spherical high-contrast: 0.001+/-0.104 and low-contrast: 0.224+/-0.107) and follow-up (toric high-contrast: -0.083+/-0.087 and low-contrast: 0.108+/-0.107 vs. spherical high-contrast: -0.015+/-0.095 and low-contrast: 0.211+/-0.104) (all P<0.0001). Electromyography-measured eyestrain was less with toric versus spherical contact lenses at fitting (least-square ratio of toric over spherical=0.72; P=0.0019) but not at follow-up (ratio=0.86; P=0.11). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that toric contact lenses provided improved objective measures of vision in a low-to-moderate astigmatic population.",

    "AB": "Aim: To clinically assess the efficacy of resin infiltration versus fluoride varnish for arresting white spot lesions (WSLs) on permanent teeth in children. Subjects and Methods: Among the children referred to the our University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Pediatric Dentistry, 23 aged between 8-14 with 81 anterior WSLs were included in the study. The participants were randomly assigned to either the resin infiltration group or the fluoride varnish group. WSLs were assessed using a laser fluorescence device (DIAGNOdent pen, Kavo, Germany) and were characterized at baseline, immediately following resin infiltration application and at a 6-month follow-up. For the statistical analyses, the IBM SPSS Statistics 22 (IBM SPSS, Turkey) program was used to assess the findings of the study. Results: Participant retention was 100% at 6 months. There was no significant difference between the two groups when baseline DIAGNOdent (DD) values were compared (P > 0.05). The reduction in 6-month follow-up DD values were statistically significant in both groups relative to baseline values. The 6-month values of the resin infiltration group were statistically lower than those of the fluoride varnish group (P = 0.028, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Resin infiltration and fluoride varnish are clinically feasible and efficacious methods for the treatment of anterior WSLs. The inhibition of caries progression by resin infiltration should now be considered an alternative to fluoride treatment.",

Background: Foot and ankle characteristics and dynamic knee valgus differ in people with and without patellofemoral (PF) pain. However, it is unknown if these characteristics are evident in people with PF osteoarthritis (OA), compared to pain-free older adults. Objectives: To compare foot and ankle mobility, foot posture and dynamic knee valgus, measured as the frontal plane projection angle (FPPA) during single-leg squatting, between individuals with and without PFOA. Methods: Fifty-one participants with PFOA (66% women, mean +/- SD age 57 +/- 10 years, body mass index (BMI) 27 +/- 6 kg/m(2)), and 23 controls (56% women, age 56 +/- 9 years, BMI 24 +/- 4 kg/m(2)) had ankle dorsiflexion measured using the knee-to-wall test, foot mobility calculated as the difference in midfoot height or width between non-weightbearing and weightbearing, and static foot posture characterized utilizing the Foot Posture Index. Peak FPPA was determined from video recordings while participants performed 5 single-leg squats. Linear regressions examined between-groups relationships for foot and ankle characteristics and the FPPA. Results: The PFOA group had less ankle dorsiflexion (odds ratio 6.7, 95% confidence interval 2.46-18.2), greater midfoot height mobility (5.2, 1.78-15.14) and width mobility (4.3, 1.33-14.39), and greater foot mobility magnitude (8.4, 2.32-30.69) than controls. There was no difference in FPPA (knee valgus angle) between groups (15, 0.63-377.99). Conclusion: Foot and ankle characteristics were different in individuals with PFOA compared to control participants, however there was no difference in dynamic knee valgus during single leg squat. Clinical interventions to address greater foot mobility may be relevant for PFOA.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Based on epidemiological and clinical data acute appendicitis can present either as uncomplicated (70-80%) or complicated (20-30%) disease. Recent studies have shown that antibiotic therapy is both safe and cost-effective for a CT-scan confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis. However, based on the study protocols to ensure patient safety, these randomised studies used mainly broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics requiring additional hospital resources and prolonged hospital stay. As we now know that antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis is feasible and safe, further studies evaluating optimisation of the antibiotic treatment regarding both antibiotic spectrum and shorter hospital stay are needed to evaluate antibiotics as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis. METHODS: APPAC II trial is a multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial comparing per oral (p.o.) antibiotic monotherapy with intravenous (i.v.) antibiotic therapy followed by p.o. antibiotics in the treatment of CT-scan confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Adult patients with CT-scan diagnosed uncomplicated acute appendicitis will be enrolled in nine Finnish hospitals. The intended sample size is 552 patients. Primary endpoint is the success of the randomised treatment, defined as resolution of acute appendicitis resulting in discharge from the hospital without the need for surgical intervention and no recurrent appendicitis during one-year follow-up. Secondary endpoints include post-intervention complications, late recurrence of acute appendicitis after one year, duration of hospital stay, pain, quality of life, sick leave and treatment costs. Primary endpoint will be evaluated in two stages: point estimates with 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated for both groups and proportion difference between groups with 95% CI will be calculated and evaluated based on 6 percentage point non-inferiority margin. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, APPAC II trial is the first randomised controlled trial comparing per oral antibiotic monotherapy with intravenous antibiotic therapy continued by per oral antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis. The APPAC II trial aims to add clinical evidence on the debated role of antibiotics as the first-line treatment for a CT-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis as well as to optimise the non-operative treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Registered healthcare workers worldwide have a high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, particularly of the back. Multidisciplinary interventions among these workers have improved fear avoidance beliefs, but not low back pain (LBP) and related sickness absences, cost-effectiveness studies are scarce. Our purpose was to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three intervention-arms (combined neuromuscular exercise and back care counselling or either alone) compared with non-treatment. METHODS: We randomly assigned female healthcare workers with recurrent non-specific LBP to one of four study-arms: Combined neuromuscular exercise and back care counseling; Exercise; Counseling; and no intervention Control. We assessed the effectiveness of the interventions on intensity of LBP, pain interfering with work and fear avoidance beliefs against the Control, and calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for sickness absence and QALY. RESULTS: We conducted three sub-studies in consecutive years of 2011, 2012, and 2013 to reach an adequate sample size. All together 219 women were randomized within each sub-study, of whom 74 and 68% had adequate questionnaire data at 6 and 12 months, respectively. No adverse events occurred. Compliance rates varied between intervention-arms. After 12 months, the Combined-arm showed reduced intensity of LBP (p = 0.006; effect size 0.70, confidence interval 0.23 to 1.17) and pain interfering with work (p = 0.011) compared with the Control-arm. Work-related fear of pain was reduced in both the Combined- (p = 0.003) and Exercise-arm (p = 0.002). Physical activity-related fear was reduced only in the Exercise-arm (p = 0.008). During the study period (0-12 months) mean total costs were lowest in the Combined-arm (euro476 vs. euro1062-euro1992, p < 0.001) as were the mean number of sickness absence days (0.15 vs. 2.29-4.17, p = 0.025). None of the intervention-arms was cost-effective for sickness absence. There was 85% probability of exercise-arm being cost-effective if willing to pay euro3550 for QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise once a week for 6 months combined with five sessions of back care counseling after working hours in real-life settings effectively reduced the intensity of LBP, work interference due to LBP, and fear of pain, but was not cost-effective.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a rapid progressive neurodegenerative disease, characterized by a selective loss of motor neurons, brain stem and spinal cord which leads to deterioration of motor abilities. Devices that promote interaction with tasks on computers can enhance performance and lead to greater independence and utilization of technology. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate performance on a computer task in individuals with ALS using three different commonly used non-immersive devices. METHOD: Thirty individuals with ALS (18 men and 12 women, mean age 59 years, range 44-74 years) with a mean score of 26, (minimum score of 14 and maximum 41) on the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and 30 healthy controls matched for age and gender, participated. All participants were randomly divided into three groups, each using a different device system (motion tracking, finger motion control or touchscreen) to perform three task phases (acquisition, retention and transfer). RESULTS: Both the ALS and control group (CG) showed better performance on the computer task when using the touchscreen device, but there was limited transfer of performance onto the task performed on the Finger Motion control or motion tracking. However, we found that using the motion tracking device led to transfer of performance to the touchscreen. CONCLUSION: This study presents novel and important findings when selecting interaction devices for individuals with ALS to access technology by demonstrating immediate performance benefits of using a touchscreen device, such as improvement of motor skills. There were possible transferable skills obtained when using virtual systems which may allow flexibility and enable individuals to maintain performance overtime.

    "AB": "Several studies have linked increased intake of dietary fibre to improvement in the management of body weight. Dietary fibre from resistant starch (RS) has been shown to have an impact on food intake in normal weight individuals, but its role in obesity is unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the short-term effects of RS on appetite, satiety and postprandial metabolism in overweight/obese subjects. In this single-blind randomized crossover study, overweight/obese healthy males consumed a test breakfast and lunch containing either 48 g RS or a placebo. Postprandial qualitative appetite, glucose, insulin, and GLP-1 were measured every 30 min for 7 h. Energy intake values from an ad libitum dinner and for a 24-h period were assessed. Acute consumption of RS at breakfast/lunch significantly reduced the energy intake at the ad libitum dinner (p = 0.017). No significant effect over 24 h or qualitative feelings of satiety were observed. Significant treatment x time effects were found for postprandial glucose (p = 0.004) for RS compared to placebo, with a trend for higher C-peptide concentrations following RS. The postprandial insulin and GLP-1 responses were not significantly different. RS may indeed have short-term beneficial effects in obese individuals.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Studies have reported that the ED50 of intrathecal ropivacaine was increased when using prophylactic infusion of phenylephrine to prevent spinal-induced hypotension. However, ED95 is more meaningful to clinical practice than ED50. Therefore, we conducted this study to determine the 95% effective dose (ED95) of intrathecal hyperbaric ropivacaine for cesarean section in parturients receiving prophylactic infusion of phenylephrine to prevent spinal-induced hypotension. METHODS: A hundred of healthy parturients undergoing elective cesarean section under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) were enrolled in this randomized, double-blinded, dose-ranging study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 7, 9, 11, 13 or 15 mg intrathecal hyperbaric ropivacaine respectively. The prophylactic phenylephrine infusion (50 mug/min) was initiated immediately at the same time of spinal injection. Successful spinal anesthesia was defined as a T5 sensory level achieved within 10 min after intrathecal drug administration and no epidural supplement was required during the surgery. The ED95 was calculated with Probit analysis. RESULTS: The ED95 of intrathecal ropivacaine with 5 mug sufentanil for successful anesthesia was 15.2 mg (95%CI, 13.5-18.8 mg), when receiving prophylactic infusion of phenylephrine. CONCLUSION: Under the conditions of the present study, the ED95 of intrathecal hyperbaric ropivacaine for successful spinal anesthesia for cesarean section in healthy parturient receiving prophylactic infusion of phenylephrine was 15.2 mg.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: A lumbar herniated intervertebral disc (LHIVD) is a common problem that usually causes low back pain and radiating pain. The effectiveness of Bosinji, one of the herbal medicines used for low back pain and radiating pain in patient with LHIVD, has been reported in several studies; however, little clinical evidence is available owing to the methodological limitations in previous studies. Hence, the present study aims to establish the clinical evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of Bosinji in improving pain, function, and quality of life in LHIVD patients. METHOD/DESIGN: This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled, and equivalence trial with 2 parallel arms. A total of 74 patients who have low back pain and radiating pain due to LHIVD will be recruited and randomly allocated to the experimental group and control group. The patients in the experimental group and control group will take 2.5 g of Bosinji granule (1.523 g of Bosinji extract) or Loxonin tablet (60 mg of loxoprofen) 3 times a day for 6 weeks. Additionally, both groups will receive the same acupuncture treatment once a week for 6 weeks as a concurrent treatment. Changes in the 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) for low back pain after 6 weeks from baseline will be assessed as the primary outcome. Furthermore, the 100-mm VAS for radiating pain, Oswestry disability index (ODI), Roland-Morris disability questionnaire (RMDQ), EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L), global perceived effect (GPE), and deficiency syndrome of kidney index (DSKI) will be used to evaluate secondary outcomes. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 10 weeks after screening. For the safety evaluation, laboratory examinations including complete blood count, liver function test, renal function test, blood coagulation test, inflammation test, and urine analysis will be conducted before and after taking the medications. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will be used to establish clinical evidence regarding the use of Bosinji with acupuncture treatment in the treatment of patients with LHIVD.

    "AB": "There is currently no standard therapeutic regimen available for patients with advanced colorectal cancer in whom the disease continues to progress after 2 or more lines of chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in patients with advanced colorectal cancer for whom at least two lines of prior chemotherapy had failed.Twenty seven patients with advanced colorectal cancer who had failed at least 2 lines chemotherapy were treated with apatinib (500 mg/day). As a comparison control, 26 advanced colorectal cancer patients with comparable clinical baseline characteristics including age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, pathological type, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, tumor location, number and location(s) of metastasis, and previous chemotherapies were subject to observation. Survival analyses were performed via the Kaplan-Meier method. The toxicity were evaluated in all patients this study according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria 4 (NCI CTC version 4.0).A total of 53 well-matched patients with advanced colorectal cancer were retrospectively analyzed. The median follow-up time was 6.0 months (2.0-16.0 months). The median PFS was significantly longer for apatinib group than for observation group (2.0 vs. 1.1 months; HR = 3.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.91-7.88; P < .001). However, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups for median OS (5.0 vs. 4.0 months; HR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.56-1.90; P = .914). The disease control rate of the apatinib group was significantly better than that of the observation group (70.4% vs 26.9%, P = .002). There was no significant difference in the overall remission rate between the 2 groups (3.7% vs 0%, P = .322). Advanced colorectal cancer patients with 2 or fewer metastatic sites experienced longer PFS than those with more than 2 sites. High ECOG scores, cancer localization to the right side of colon and lymph node metastasis were associated with increased risk of death and all remained independent factors affecting OS. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were hypertension and hand-foot skin syndrome.Apatinib treatment for patients with advanced colorectal cancer who had failed chemotherapy achieved better disease control and prolonged PFS relative to untreated controls. The toxicity was manageable.",

However, limited studies to investigate the association of health education via Wechat platform on increased the basic self-care skills and glycemic control rate in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A total number of 120 type 2 diabetes patients were randomized into intervention (health education by Wechat platform plus usual care) and the control group (usual care). Biochemical parameters including fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose (2hPG), glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were measured among the 2 groups at baseline 6-month and 12-month. Diabetes Management Self-Efficacy (SE) Scale was completed at baseline 6-month and 12-month. RESULTS: Significant difference of HbA1c concentration and SE were found between intervention and control groups at 6-month and 12-month (P <.05). The effect of groups and health education duration times was found on reduced HbA1c concentration and increased the total score of SE (P <.05). No significant difference of FPG and 2hPG concentrations were found between intervention and control groups at 6 months and 12 months (P >.05). CONCLUSION: Health education of diabetic individuals via Wechat platform in conjunction with conventional diabetes treatment could improve glycemic control and positively influence other aspects of diabetes self-care skills.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Many surgical procedures have been described to treat recurrent patellar dislocation, but none of these techniques has been successful in all patients. The goal of the study was to evaluate the results of medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction in children. Two operative procedures were evaluated; a fascia lata allograft and an autologous gracilis graft. METHODS: Forty-four children (27 girls and 17 boys) between 13 and 17 years of age with unilateral recurrent patellar dislocation underwent medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction. Patients were operated in two orthopedic centers. The 1st group contained 22 patients and surgery was performed using a fascia lata allograft. In the 2nd group of patients which also contained 22 children and autologous gracilis graft was used. The mean age of the patients was 14.9 years and the mean follow-up was 24 months. Preoperatively, all patients were evaluated clinically (Kujala score questionnaire) and radiologically. The same evaluation was used 18 to 30 months postoperatively to estimate the results of our treatment. RESULTS: In 1st group of children operated with cadaver allografts, the Kujala score significantly improved from 73.91 points preoperatively to 94.50 points postoperatively (P < .001). The average duration of operating procedure was 1 hour and 35 minutes. As shown by subjective symptoms, the results in 95% of patients were rated as good or very good. All children returned to full activity. Similar results were obtained in patients in 2nd group, where MPFL was reconstructed with ipsilateral gracilis tendon. Kujala score increased from 70.77 points preoperatively to 94.32 postoperatively (P < .001). Our results were estimated as good or very good in 93% of patients. All patients that were operated returned to full activity. However, median duration of operation was longer and lasted 1 hour and 55 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Both techniques were effective in the short-term (18-30 months) in treatment of recurrent patellar dislocation. The use of cadaver allograft spares the hamstring muscles and reduces the time of surgery. Therefore, such study appears to be useful because it provides valuable information that would help to guide treatment of this condition in children. Level of evidence II-2.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Endotracheal intubation for general anesthesia causes postoperative sore throat (POST). This study is designed to evaluate the effect of high-dose remifentanil on the incidence of POST in patients after general anesthesia. METHODS: Ninety-two patients scheduled for orthopedic lower extremity surgery under general anesthesia were randomly assigned into 1 of 2 groups. In the high-dose remifentanil (HR) group (n = 46), remifentanil was infused at a rate of 0.25 mug/kg/min and subsequently increased or decreased by 0.05 mug/kg/min per clinical demand. In the low-dose remifentanil (LR) group (n = 46), remifentanil was infused at a rate of 0.05 mug/kg/min. The incidence of POST was monitored at 0, 2, 4, and 24 hours postoperatively. Complications regarding opioids were compared between groups. RESULTS: The overall incidence of POST was higher in the HR group compared with that in the LR group [33 (72%) vs 18 (39%), P = .022]. The incidence of POST at 0, 2, and 24 hours after surgery was higher in the HR group compared with that in the LR group (P < .001, P = .001, and P = .001, respectively). The incidence of postoperative nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and headache was similar between the groups. The incidence of postoperative shivering was higher in the HR group than in the LR group [10 (22%) vs 2 (4%), difference 17%, 95% CI 2%-33%, P = .027]. CONCLUSION: A relatively large dose of intraoperative remifentanil increased the incidence of POST in patients for orthopedic surgery under general anesthesia.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) images for rhinosinusitis may have a risk of radiation hazards. Reduction in radiation dose may lead to a compromise in quality of MDCT images and have chances of postoperative complications. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to test the applicability of low-dose MDCT protocols for decision-making of sinus surgeries of patients with uncontrolled chronic rhinosinusitis. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind (patients and evaluators blind), controlled, trial. SETTING: People's Hospital of Guanghan, China. PATIENTS: A total of 288 patients with clinically confirmed uncontrolled chronic rhinosinusitis were subjected to randomization (1:1 ratio). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were subjected to low-dose preoperative protocols of MDCT (n = 144; ldMDCT group) or standard-dose preoperative protocols of MDCT (n = 144; sdMDCT group). OUTCOME MEASURES: Image analysis was performed by the workstation. Lund-Mackay score, modified Lund-Mackay score, estimated radiation exposure, and surgical complications were evaluated for each patient. The chi independent test or 2-tailed paired t test were performed for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The preoperative MDCT images for standard-dose protocol had better quality than low-dose protocol (P < .001, q = 4.57). The area of images that give confidence for sinus surgery at one time was higher for standard-dose MDCT protocol technique than low-dose MDCT protocol method. Patients of ldMDCT group with large growth of nasal polyps (P = .03, q = 5.35) and complete opacification of sinuses (P = .03, q = 7.94) had complications after sinus surgeries. Either low-dose or standard-dose MDCT protocol was performed, the experience of otolaryngologist had decreased complication after surgeries. CONCLUSION: Preoperative low-dose MDCT should be used for diagnosis of uncontrolled chronic rhinosinusitis for decision making of sinus surgeries. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.

    "AB": "PURPOSE: This report assesses functional mobility in children with neurological impairments and documented gross motor delays, before and after receiving either hippotherapy or standard outpatient physical therapy (PT). SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS: This is a case-series report using data previously collected for a discontinued randomized controlled trial, in which participants received hippotherapy or standard outpatient clinic PT for a 12-week treatment period. Results demonstrated both subjective and objective functional mobility improvements after treatment in participants receiving hippotherapy and standard outpatient PT, as determined by the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2, the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory, and the Goal Attainment Scaling. STATEMENT OF CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE:: When compared with standard outpatient PT, hippotherapy appears to be a viable treatment strategy for children aged 2 to 5 years with neurological impairments and gross motor delays, but additional research in this area is needed to validate findings.",

    "AB": "PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of 3 different methods for delivering instruction on infant handling to parents in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). METHODS: Ninety-six parents in the NICU received instruction. Parents were taught the same 3 infant-handling techniques after random assignment to the (1) direct, (2) video, or (3) written-pictorial instructional groups. After baseline competency assessment, parents received instruction according to their group. A masked evaluator assessed parent performance, and parents rated instructional effectiveness. RESULTS: All groups significantly improved handling performance. The direct and video groups performed 2 handling activities significantly better than the written-pictorial group. No significant differences were found between the direct and video groups. All groups perceived the instruction as effective. CONCLUSIONS: Direct and video instructions are equally effective in teaching parents to perform simple whole motor tasks in the NICU, and parents welcome the instruction.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Pegbelfermin (BMS-986036), a PEGylated human fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) analogue, has previously been shown to improve markers of metabolism and liver fibrosis in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. In this phase 2a study, we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pegbelfermin in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 2a study, we recruited adults (aged 21-75 years) with a body-mass index of at least 25 kg/m(2), biopsy-confirmed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (fibrosis stage 1-3), and a hepatic fat fraction of at least 10% when assessed by magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction. These patients were enrolled at 17 medical centres in the USA. Eligible patients were stratified by type 2 diabetes status and they were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by a computer-based system to receive subcutaneous injections of placebo once a day, 10 mg pegbelfermin once a day, or 20 mg pegbelfermin once a week, all for 16 weeks. Participants, the study team administering treatment, and investigators analysing outcomes (who were independent of the study team and had no further involvement) were masked to treatment groups. The primary outcomes were safety and the absolute change in hepatic fat fraction after 16 weeks of treatment. All patients who were randomly assigned to groups and received the study drug or placebo were included in the primary analyses. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02413372. FINDINGS: Between May 12, 2015, and Aug 4, 2016, 184 overweight or obese patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis were screened for study inclusion. Of these, 95 (52%) patients were excluded because they no longer met study criteria and 80 (43%) patients entered the placebo lead-in phase. After further exclusions, 75 (94%) patients were randomly assigned to groups, received at least one dose of treatment (25 patients to receive 10 mg pegbelfermin once a day; 24 patients to receive 20 mg pegbelfermin once a week, and 26 patients to receive placebo), and were included in the primary analysis. A prespecified interim analysis at week 8 showed a greater than expected change in the primary outcome and supported early closing of patient enrolment, since this analysis indicated that the full planned sample size was not needed. We observed a significant decrease in absolute hepatic fat fraction in the group receiving 10 mg pegbelfermin daily (-6.8% vs -1.3%; p=0.0004) and in the group receiving 20 mg pegbelfermin weekly (-5.2% vs -1.3%; p=0.008) compared with the placebo group. Most adverse events were mild; the most common events were diarrhoea in eight (16%) of 49 patients treated with pegbelfermin and two (8%) of 26 patients treated with placebo and nausea in seven (14%) patients treated with pegbelfermin and two (8%) patients treated with placebo. There were no deaths, discontinuations due to adverse events, or treatment-related serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Treatment with subcutaneously administered pegbelfermin for 16 weeks was generally well tolerated and significantly reduced hepatic fat fraction in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Further study of pegbelfermin is warranted in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Additional studies that use liver biopsies would allow for the assessment of pegbelfermin's effects on liver histology. Moreover, further studies should allow assessments of the safety and effectiveness of pegbelfermin in a larger number of patients. FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVES: To determine if intermittent exercise-heat exposures (IHE) every fifth day sustain heat acclimation (HA) adaptations 25 days after initial HA. DESIGN: Randomized control trial. METHODS: Sixteen non-heat acclimatized men heat acclimated during 10-11 days of exercise in the heat (40 degrees C, 40% RH). A heat stress test (120min, 45% V O2peak) before (Pre HA) and after HA (Post HA) in similar hot conditions assessed HA status. Pair-matched participants were randomized into a control group (CON; n=7) that exercised in a temperate environment (24 degrees C, 21%RH) or IHE group (n=9) that exercised in a hot environment (40 degrees C, 40%RH) every fifth day for 25 days following HA (+25d) with out-of-laboratory exercise intensity and duration recorded. Both groups completed +25d in the hot condition. RESULTS: Both groups heat acclimated similarly (p>0.05) evidenced by lower heart rate (HR), thermoregulatory, physiological, and perceptual responses (perceived exertion, fatigue, thermal sensation) Pre HA vs. Post HA (p</=0.05). At +25d, post-exercise HR (p=0.01) and physiological strain index (p<0.05) but neither Tre (p=0.18) nor sweat rate (p=0.44) were lower in IHE vs. CON. In IHE only, post-exercise Tre and perceptual responses at Post HA and +25d were lower than Pre HA (p</=0.01). +25d post-exercise epinephrine was higher in CON vs. IHE (p=0.04). Exercise intensity during out-of-lab exercise and +25d post-exercise HR were correlated (r=-0.89, p=0.02) in IHE. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise-heat exposures every fifth day for 25 days and regular intense physical activity after HA sustained HR and Tre adaptations and reduced perceptual and physiological strain during exercise-heat stress approximately 1 month later.",

    "AB": "PURPOSE: To determine the effects of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) injection on dry eye signs, symptoms, and tear cytokine levels in patients with intractable dry eye disease (DED). METHODS: In this prospective study, patients with intractable DED were randomized to a BTX-A (group A) or control group (group B). Patients were injected with BTX-A or normal saline in the medial part of the upper and lower eyelids. Before and at 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, and 4 months after injection, dry eye signs; tear film break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer I test, corneal fluorescein staining (CFS), and symptoms; ocular surface disease index (OSDI); and frequency of lubricants were assessed. The tear levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and serotonin were measured before and at 1 month after injection. RESULTS: Fifty-two eyes from 26 patients (mean age, 57.7 years) were included. The TBUT was higher at 2 weeks and at 1 month in group A. The Schirmer I test and OSDI scores were also better in group A for up to 2 months. The CFS grades in group A were significantly lower until 4 months. Repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) demonstrated significant differences between the two groups over time for the Schirmer I test (p = 0.002), CFS (p = 0.025), OSDI (p = 0.020), and frequency of lubricants (p = 0.029). The MMP-9 conversion rate of group A (76.92%) was significantly higher than that of group B (38.46%, p = 0.005). The tear serotonin level in group A was reduced from 2.76 +/- 0.34 to 1.73 +/- 0.14 ng/mL (p < 0.001). No complications were observed during the study. CONCLUSION: BTX-A injection into the medial part of eyelid improves dry eye signs and symptoms and reduces tear cytokine levels. BTX-A is thus a potential treatment option for patients with intractable DED.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Counterforce orthoses are used to manage lateral elbow tendinopathy, and their effectiveness in improving motor function has been documented. Little is known about the impact of bracing on sensory function. The objective of this study was to investigate the immediate effectiveness of 2 counterforce orthoses in improving the sensorimotor abilities of the hand in patients with lateral elbow tendinopathy. METHODS: In this crossover, randomized controlled trial, elbow proprioception, pain severity, pain-free grip strength, and finger dexterity were measured in 50 participants with a diagnosis of lateral elbow tendinopathy. Outcomes were measured in 3 randomized conditions (no brace, forearm band, or elbow sleeve). Data were analyzed using 1-way repeated-measures analysis of variance for each outcome measure. RESULTS: Better scores were observed with the forearm band, as compared with no orthosis, for multiple outcomes including joint position reproduction score at 70 degrees of elbow flexion (P = .006), pain (P < .001), grip strength (P = .01), and dexterity (P < .001). The elbow sleeve yielded better scores than no orthosis for the following outcomes: joint position reproduction score at 110 degrees (P < .001), pain (P < .001), and grip strength (P = .012). No statistically significant difference was found between the orthoses' effects on pain reduction and grip strength (P > .05). The forearm band showed better scores on joint position reproduction at 70 degrees compared with the elbow sleeve (P = .006), whereas the elbow sleeve showed better scores at 110 degrees (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Our results support the mechanisms occurring with the use of either of the described orthotic interventions. Future randomized trials with longer-term outcomes that include sensorimotor mechanisms might enhance our understanding of the comparative effectiveness.",

    "AB": "Infant colic is a common condition of unknown pathogenesis that brings frustration to families seeking for effective management. Accumulating evidence suggests that some single strains of lactobacilli may play a positive dietary role in attenuation of colic in exclusively breastfed infants. The objective of this study was to evaluate a mixture of two Lactobacillus strains in decreasing infant cry and fuss in this population. Infants aged 4(-)12 weeks received L. rhamnosus 19070-2 and L. reuteri 12246 in a daily dose of 250 x 10(6) CFU, 3.33 mg of fructooligosaccharide, and 200 IU of vitamin D(3) (84 infants, probiotic group) or just vitamin D(3) (84 infants, control group) for 28 days. Cry and fuss time were measured with validated Baby's Day Diary on days 0 and 28. At baseline, mean (SD) duration of cry and fuss time was comparable in the probiotic and control groups: 305 (81) vs. 315 (90) min., respectively (p = 0.450). On day 28, mean cry and fuss time became statistically different: 142 (89) vs. 199 (72), respectively (p < 0.05). Mean change in cry and fuss time from day 0 through day 28 was -163 (99) minutes in the probiotic and -116 (94) minutes in the control group (p = 0.019). Our findings confirm that lactobacilli decrease cry and fuss time and provide a dietary support in exclusively breastfed infants with colic.",

    "AB": "Mindfulness meditation interventions-which train skills in monitoring present-moment experiences with a lens of acceptance-have shown promise for increasing positive emotions. Using a theory-based approach, we hypothesized that learning acceptance skills in mindfulness interventions helps people notice more positive experiences in daily life, and tested whether removing acceptance training from mindfulness interventions would eliminate intervention-related boosts in positive affect. In 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of stressed community adults, mindfulness skills were dismantled into 2 structurally equivalent interventions: (a) training in both monitoring and acceptance (Monitor + Accept) and (b) training in monitoring only (Monitor Only) without acceptance training. Study 1 tested 8-week group-based Monitor + Accept and Monitor Only interventions compared with a no treatment control group. Study 2 tested 2-week smartphone-based Monitor + Accept and Monitor Only interventions compared with an active control training. In both studies, end-of-day and momentary positive affect and negative affect were measured in daily life for 3 days pre- and post-intervention using ambulatory assessments. As predicted, across 2 RCTs, Monitor + Accept training increased positive affect compared with both Monitor Only and control groups. In Study 1, this effect was observed in end-of-day positive affect. In Study 2, this effect was found in both end-of-day and momentary positive affect outcomes. In contrast, all active interventions in Studies 1 and 2 decreased negative affect. These studies provide the first experimental evidence that developing an orientation of acceptance toward present-moment experiences is a central mechanism of mindfulness interventions for boosting positive emotions in daily life.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Large scale administration of the anthelminthic drug praziquantel (PZQ) to at-risk populations is the cornerstone of schistosomiasis control, although persisting high prevalence of infections in some areas and growing concerns of PZQ resistance have revealed the limitations of this strategy. Most studies assessing PZQ efficacy have used relatively insensitive parasitological diagnostics, such as the Kato-Katz (KK) and urine-filtration methods, thereby overestimating cure rates (CRs). This study aims to determine the efficacy of repeated PZQ treatments against Schistosoma mansoni infection in school-aged children in Cote d'Ivoire using the traditional KK technique, as well as more sensitive antigen- and DNA-detection methods. METHODS: An open-label, randomised controlled trial will be conducted in school-aged children (5 to 18 years) from the region of Taabo, Cote d'Ivoire, an area endemic for S. mansoni. This 8-week trial includes four two-weekly standard doses of PZQ in the \"intense treatment\" intervention group and one standard dose of PZQ in the \"standard treatment\" control group. The efficacy of PZQ will be evaluated in stool samples using the KK technique and real-time PCR as well as in urine using the point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen test and the up-converting phosphor, lateral flow, circulating anodic antigen assay. The primary outcome of the study will be the difference in CR of intense versus standard treatment with PZQ on individuals with a confirmed S. mansoni infection measured by KK. Secondary outcomes include the difference in CR and intensity reduction rate between the intense and standard treatment groups as measured by the other diagnostic tests, as well as the accuracy of the different diagnostic tests, and the safety of PZQ. DISCUSSION: This study will provide data on the efficacy of repeated PZQ treatment on the clearance of S. mansoni as measured by several diagnostic techniques. These findings will inform future mass drug administration policy and shed light on position of novel diagnostic tools to evaluate schistosomiasis control strategies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is registered at EudraCT (2016-003017-10, date of registration: 22 July 2016) and ( NCT02868385 , date of registration: 16 August 2016).",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: To combat emerging drug resistance in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) the World Health Organization and GMS countries have committed to eliminating malaria in the region by 2030. The overall approach includes providing universal access to diagnosis and treatment of malaria, and sustainable preventive measures, including vector control. Topical repellents are an intervention that can be used to target residual malaria transmission not covered by long lasting insecticide nets and indoor residual spraying. Although there is strong evidence that topical repellents protect against mosquito bites, evidence is not well established for the effectiveness of repellents distributed as part of malaria control activities in protecting against episodes of malaria. A common approach to deliver malaria services is to assign Village Health Volunteers (VHVs) to villages, particularly where limited or no services exist. The proposed trial aims to provide evidence for the effectiveness of repellent distributed through VHVs in reducing malaria. METHODS: The study is an open stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial randomised at the village level. Using this approach, repellent (N,N-diethyl-benzamide - 12% w/w, cream) is distributed by VHVs in villages sequentially throughout the malaria transmission season. Villages will be grouped into blocks, with blocks transitioned monthly from control (no repellent) to intervention states (to receive repellent) across 14 monthly intervals in random order). This follows a 4-week baseline period where all villages do not receive repellent. The primary endpoint is defined as the number of individuals positive for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections diagnosed by a rapid diagnostic test. Secondary endpoints include symptomatic malaria, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-detectable Plasmodium spp. infections, molecular markers of drug resistance and antibodies specific for Plasmodium spp. parasites. DISCUSSION: This study has been approved by relevant institutional ethics committees in Myanmar and Australia. Results will be disseminated through workshops, conferences and peer-reviewed publications. Findings will contribute to a better understanding of the optimal distribution mechanisms of repellent, context specific effectiveness and inform policy makers and implementers of malaria elimination programs in the GMS.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Maintenance therapy following autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) can delay disease progression and prolong survival in patients with multiple myeloma. Ixazomib is ideally suited for maintenance therapy given its convenient once-weekly oral dosing and low toxicity profile. In this study, we aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of ixazomib as maintenance therapy following ASCT. METHODS: The phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled TOURMALINE-MM3 study took place in 167 clinical or hospital sites in 30 countries in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and North and South America. Eligible participants were adults with a confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma according to International Myeloma Working Group criteria who had achieved at least a partial response after undergoing standard-of-care induction therapy followed by high-dose melphalan (200 mg/m(2)) conditioning and single ASCT within 12 months of diagnosis. Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to oral ixazomib or matching placebo on days 1, 8, and 15 in 28-day cycles for 2 years following induction, high-dose therapy, and transplantation. The initial 3 mg dose was increased to 4 mg from cycle 5 if tolerated during cycles 1-4. Randomisation was stratified by induction regimen, pre-induction disease stage, and response post-transplantation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by intention-to-treat analysis. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of ixazomib or placebo, according to treatment actually received. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02181413, and follow-up is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between July 31, 2014, and March 14, 2016, 656 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive ixazomib maintenance therapy (n=395) or placebo (n=261). With a median follow-up of 31 months (IQR 27.3-35.7), we observed a 28% reduction in the risk of progression or death with ixazomib versus placebo (median PFS 26.5 months [95% CI 23.7-33.8] vs 21.3 months [18.0-24.7]; hazard ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.58-0.89; p=0.0023). No increase in second malignancies was noted with ixazomib therapy (12 [3%] patients) compared with placebo (eight [3%] patients) at the time of this analysis. 108 (27%) of 394 patients in the ixazomib group and 51 (20%) of 259 patients in the placebo group experienced serious adverse events. During the treatment period, one patient died in the ixazomib group and none died in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION: Ixazomib maintenance prolongs PFS and represents an additional option for post-transplant maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Hypomethylating agents, such as decitabine, are the standard of care for older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia. Single-arm studies have suggested that a 10-day schedule of decitabine cycles leads to better outcomes than the usual 5-day schedule. We compared the efficacy and safety of these two schedules. METHODS: Eligible patients were aged 60 years or older with acute myeloid leukaemia but unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy (or <60 years if unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy with an anthracycline plus cytarabine). The first 40 patients were allocated equally to the two treatment groups by computer-generated block randomisation (block size 40), after which a response-adaptive randomisation algorithm used all previous patients' treatment and response data to decide the allocation of each following patient favouring the group with superior response. Patients were assigned to receive 20 mg/m(2) decitabine intravenously for 5 or 10 consecutive days as induction therapy, every 4-8 weeks for up to three cycles. Responding patients received decitabine as consolidation therapy on a 5-day schedule for up to 24 cycles. We assessed a composite primary endpoint of complete remission, complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp), and complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery (CRi) achieved at any time and assessed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01786343. FINDINGS: Between Feb 28, 2013, and April 12, 2018, 71 patients were enrolled. 28 received decitabine for 5 days and 43 for 10 days, and all were assessable for efficacy and safety. The primary endpoint was achieved in similar proportions of patients in the two treatment groups (12 [43%] of 28 in the 5-day schedule group, 95% credible interval 26-60, and 17 [40%] of 43 in the 10-day schedule group, 26-54, p=0.78; difference 3%, -21 to 27). Total follow-up was 38.2 months, during which the median duration of overall survival was 5.5 months (IQR 2.1-11.7) in the 5-day group and 6.0 months (1.9-11.7) in the 10-day group. 1-year overall survival was 25% in both groups. Complete remission, CRp, CRi, and overall survival did not differ between groups when stratified by cytogenetics, de-novo versus secondary or therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia, or TP53(mut) status. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenic fever (seven patients [25%] in the 5-day group and 14 [33%] in the 10-day group) and infection (five [18%] and 16 [37%], respectively). One patient (4%) died from sepsis in the context of neutropenic fever, infection, and haemorrhage in the 5-day group, and in the 10-day group six patients (14%) died from infection. Early mortality was similar in the two groups. INTERPRETATION: In older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia, efficacy and safety did not differ by the 5-day or the 10-day decitabine schedule.

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: One of the important aspects involved in achieving optimal outcomes after assisted reproductive treatment (ART) is the endometrium. Some cycles are cancelled due to inadequate endometrial growth in ART. In this clinical trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the treatment of thin endometrium. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial, 83 women with poor endometrial response to standard hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (endometrium thickness < 7 mm) in the 13th day of the cycle in a frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) were entered in two groups. In the PRP group (n = 40), in addition to HRT, 0.5-1 cc of PRP was infused into the uterine cavity on the 13th day of HRT cycle. The control group (n = 43) was only received HRT. If endometrial thickness failed to increase after 48 h, PRP infusion was repeated in the same cycle. When the endometrium thickness reached >/=7 mm, embryo transfer was done. Finally, endometrial thickness, chemical, clinical, and ongoing pregnancy rates were compared between two groups. RESULTS: Endometrial thickness increased significantly to 8.67 +/- 0.64 in PRP group than in controls (p = 0.001). This increase was higher in women who conceived in PRP group (p value: 0.031). The implantation rate and per-cycle clinical pregnancy rate were significantly higher in PRP group (p = 0.002 and 0.044, respectively (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: PRP may be effective in improving the endometrial growth, and possibly pregnancy outcomes in women with a thin endometrium.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Menstrual pain is a periodic pain which happens during the days of menses. The menstrual disturbances as a health problem among young girls affect not only reproductive, but also psychical health and quality of life. This study was done with the goal of comparing the effect of Ginger and Novafen on the menstrual pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This crossover clinical trial study was done in Iran on 168 single girl students 18-26 years old in Babol University of Medical Sciences with primary menstrual pain. The participants were randomly allocated to two groups receiving the drugs Novafen and Ginger. At the beginning of pain, in the two groups 200 mg capsule was given every 6 h for two serial cycles. Pain severity was measured by the visual scale before treatment, 1 h after consuming the drug (for 24 h) and 48 h after the onset of drug. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 21.83 +/- 2.07 years. It has been reported that the intensity of pain from dysmenorrhea decreased in the Novafen and Ginger groups. Before treatment, the average pain intensity in Novafen and Ginger users were 7.12 +/- 2.32 and 7.60 +/- 1.84, respectively and after treatment pain intensity decreased to 3.10 +/- 2.69 and 2.97 +/- 2.69, respectively. Differences between two groups each time showed no statistical significance (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Both drugs reduced menstrual pain. Ginger as well as Novafen is effective in relieving pain in girls with primary dysmenorrhea . Therefore, treatment with natural herbal medicine, non-synthetic drug, to reduce primary dysmenorrhea is recommended.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Mothers of preterm infants often have symptoms of anxiety and depression, recognized as risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases and associated with low rates of heart rate variability (HRV). This study aimed to evaluate the influence of music therapy intervention on the autonomic control of heart rate, anxiety, and depression in mothers. METHODS: Prospective randomized clinical trial including 21 mothers of preterms admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary hospital, recruited from August 2015 to September 2017, and divided into control group (CG; n = 11) and music therapy group (MTG; n = 10). Participants underwent anxiety and depression evaluation, as well as measurements of the intervals between consecutive heartbeats or RR intervals for the analysis of HRV at the first and the last weeks of hospitalization of their preterms. Music therapy sessions lasting 30-45 min were individually delivered weekly using receptive techniques. The mean and standard deviation of variables were obtained and the normality of data was analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The paired sample t-test or Wilcoxon test were employed to calculate the differences between variables before and after music therapy intervention. The correlations anxiety versus heart variables and depression versus heart variables were established using Spearman correlation test. Fisher's exact test was used to verify the differences between categorical variables. A significance level of p < 0.05 was established. Statistical analysis were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 20. RESULTS: Participants in MTG had an average of seven sessions of music therapy, and showed improvement in anxiety and depression scores and autonomic indexes of the time domain (p < 0.05). Significant correlations were found between depression and parasympathetic modulation using linear (r = - 0.687; p = 0.028) and nonlinear analyses (r = - 0.689; p = 0.027) in MTG. CONCLUSION: Music therapy had a significant and positive impact on anxiety and depression, acting on prevention of cardiovascular diseases, major threats to modern society.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with loss of lung function and poor outcomes for patients. However, there are limited data on the time course of changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) preceding the first reported symptom and after the start of an exacerbation. METHODS: WISDOM was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 52-week study in patients with severe-to-very severe COPD. Patients received triple therapy (long-acting muscarinic antagonist and long-acting beta2-agonist/inhaled corticosteroid [ICS]) for 6 weeks, and were randomized to continue triple therapy or stepwise withdrawal of the ICS (dual bronchodilator group). After suitable training, patients performed daily spirometry at home using a portable, battery-operated spirometer. In the present post hoc analysis, patients who continued to perform daily home spirometry and completed at least one measurement per week for a 56-day period before and after the start of a moderate or severe exacerbation were included. Missing values were imputed by linear interpolation (intermittent), backfilling (beginning) or carry forward (end). Exacerbation onset was the first day of a reported symptom of exacerbation. RESULTS: Eight hundred and eighty-eight patients in the WISDOM study had a moderate/severe exacerbation after the complete ICS withdrawal visit; 360 of them contributed at least one FEV1 measure per week for the 8 weeks before and after the event and are included in this analysis. Mean daily FEV1 began to decline from approximately 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms of an exacerbation, dropping from 0.907 L (mean Days - 56 to - 36 before the exacerbation) to 0.860 L on the first day of the exacerbation. After the exacerbation, mean FEV1 improved but did not return to pre-exacerbation levels (mean Days 36-56 after the exacerbation, 0.875 L). The pattern of FEV1 changes around exacerbations was similar in the triple therapy and dual bronchodilator groups, and a similar pattern was seen in moderate and severe exacerbations when analysed separately. CONCLUSIONS: Mean lung function starts to decline prior to the first reported symptoms of an exacerbation, and does not recover to pre-exacerbation levels 8 weeks after the event.

    "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Deficient levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) (<30 ng/mL) may compromise health and athletic performance. Supplementation with oral vitamin D can favor the state of iron metabolism, and testosterone and cortisol as an indicator of muscle recovery of the athlete with a deficiency. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of eight weeks of supplementation with 3000 IU/day of vitamin D on the hematological and iron metabolism profile, as well as on the analytical values of testosterone and cortisol on elite male traditional rowers. The secondary aim was to examine if serum 25(OH)D is a predictor of testosterone and cortisol levels. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-six elite male rowers (27 +/- 6 years) were assigned to one of the two groups randomly: 1) Control group (CG, n = 18, height: 181.05 +/- 3.39 cm and body mass: 77.02 +/- 7.55 kg), 2) Group treated with 3,000 IU of vitamin D3/day (VD3G, s = 18, height: 179.70 +/- 9.07 cm and body mass: 76.19 +/- 10.07 kg). The rowers were subjected to blood tests at the beginning of the study (T1) and after eight weeks of treatment (T2), for the analysis of hematological and hormonal values. Repeated-measures ANOVA with group factor (GC and GVD3) were used to examine if the interaction of the different values was the same or different between the groups throughout the study (time x group) after vitamin D3 treatment. To analyze if 25(OH)D was a good predictor of testosterone, cortisol, and testosterone/cortisol ratio a stepwise regression model was performed. RESULTS: Statistically significant and different increases were observed in the group-by-time interaction of 25(OH)D in VD3G in respect to CG during the study (p < 0.001; VD3G (T1: 26.24 +/- 8.18 ng/mL vs. T2: 48.12 +/- 10.88 ng/mL) vs CG (T1: 30.76 +/- 6.95 ng/mL vs. T2: 35.14 +/- 7.96 ng/mL). Likewise, significant differences between groups were observed throughout the study in the group-by-time interaction and changes of hemoglobin (GC: -2.89 +/- 2.29% vs. VD3G: 0.71 +/- 1.91%; p = 0.009), hematocrit (CG: -1.57 +/- 2.49% vs. VD3G: 1.16 +/- 1.81%; p = 0.019) and transferrin (CG: 0.67 +/- 4.88% vs. VD3G: 6.51 +/- 4.36%; p = 0.007). However, no differences between groups were observed in the group-by-time interaction of the hormonal parameters (p > 0.05). Regression multivariate analysis showed that cortisol and testosterone levels were associated with 25(OH)D levels (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Oral supplementation with 3000 IU/day of vitamin D3 during eight weeks showed to be sufficient to prevent a decline in hematological levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit, and improve transferrin of 25(OH)D levels. However, although it was not sufficient to enhance muscle recovery observed by testosterone and cortisol responses, it was observed that serum 25(OH)D levels could be a predictor of anabolic and catabolic hormones.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To pilot test the effectiveness of \"MyNutriCart\", a smartphone application (app) that generates healthy grocery lists, on diet and weight. METHODS: A pilot randomized trial was conducted to test the efficacy of using the \"MyNutriCart\" app compared to one face-to-face counseling session (Traditional group) in Hispanic overweight and obese adults. Household food purchasing behavior, three 24-h food recalls, Tucker's semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and weight were assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks. Statistical analyses included t tests, a Poisson regression model, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using STATA. RESULTS: 24 participants in the Traditional group and 27 in the App group completed the study. Most participants were women (>88%), with a mean age of 35.3 years, more than a high school education (>80%), a family composition of at least three members, and a mean baseline body mass index (BMI) of 34.5 kg/m(2). There were significant improvements in household purchasing of vegetables and whole grains, in individual intakes of refined grains, healthy proteins, whole-fat dairies, legumes, 100% fruit juices, and sweets and snacks; and in the individual frequency of intake of fruits and cold cuts/cured meats within the intervention group (p < 0.05). However, no significant differences were found between groups. No changes were detected in weight. CONCLUSIONS: \"MyNutriCart\" app use led to significant improvements in food-related behaviors compared to baseline, with no significant differences when compared to the Traditional group. Cost and resource savings of using the app compared to face-to-face counseling may make it a good option for interventionists.",

    "AB": "(1) Background: Spirulina (Arthrospira) maxima has shown beneficial effects such as being anti-dyslipidemic, antiviral, antioxidant and antihypertensive. However, there are few and limited clinical studies. (2) Methods: a prospective, randomized, parallel pilot study of 4.5 g administration of Spirulina maxima or placebo for 12 weeks in 16 patients with systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) undergoing treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was performed to assess the effects on endothelial damage and oxidative stress indicators. The blood levels of sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, endothelin-1, and sE-selectin were quantified; the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and concentrations of reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, were also quantified before and after the treatment period. (3) Results: There were statistically significant (p < 0.05) decreases in systolic blood pressure, sVCAM-1, sE-selectin and endothelin-1 levels, and increases in glutathione peroxidase activity and oxidized glutathione levels. (4) Conclusion: The effects found in the present study agree with antihypertensive and antioxidant effects previously reported for Spirulina maxima. However, this is the first report about the effects on indicators of endothelial damage. More research in this field is necessary to gain an insight into the effects of Spirulina on these indicators.",

    "AB": "Visual impairment is common among rural Chinese children, but fewer than a quarter of children who need glasses actually own and use them. To study the effect of rural county hospital vision centers (VC) on self-reported glasses ownership and wearing behavior (primary outcome) among rural children in China, we conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial at a VC in the government hospital of Qinan County, a nationally-designated poor county. All rural primary schools (n = 164) in the county were invited to participate. Schools were randomly assigned to either the treatment group to receive free vision care and eyeglasses, if needed, or control group, who received glasses only at the end of the study. Among 2806 eligible children with visiual impairment (visual acuity </= 6/12 in either eye), 93 (3.31%) were lost to follow-up, leaving 2713 students (45.0% boys). Among these, glasses ownership at the end of the school year was 68.6% among 1252 treatment group students (82 schools), and 26.4% (p < 0.01) among 1461 controls (82 schools). The rate of wearing glasses was 55.2% in the treatment group and 23.4% (p < 0.01) among the control group. In logistic regression models, treatment group membership was significantly associated with spectacle ownership (Odds Ratio [OR] = 11.9, p < 0.001) and wearing behavior (OR = 7.2, p < 0.001). County hospital-based vision centers appear effective in delivering childrens' glasses in rural China.",

We examined if changes in dietary intake, physical activity and weight of obese infertile women during the first six months of the LIFEstyle trial were associated with cardiometabolic health 3(-)8 years later (N = 50(-)78). Lifestyle was assessed using questionnaires and weight was measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months after randomization. BMI, blood pressure, body composition, pulse wave velocity, glycemic parameters and lipid profile were assessed 3(-)8 years after randomization. Decreases in savory and sweet snack intake were associated with lower HOMA-IR 3(-)8 years later, but these associations disappeared after adjustment for current lifestyle. No other associations between changes in lifestyle or body weight during the first six months after randomization with cardiovascular health 3(-)8 years later were observed. In conclusion, reductions in snack intake were associated with reduced insulin resistance 3(-)8 years later, but adjustment for current lifestyle reduced these associations. This indicates that changing lifestyle is an important first step, but maintaining this change is needed for improving cardiometabolic health in the long-term.",

    "AB": "Children with phenylketonuria (PKU) follow a protein restricted diet with negligible amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Low DHA intakes might explain subtle neurological deficits in PKU. We studied whether a DHA supply modified plasma DHA and neurological and intellectual functioning in PKU. In a double-blind multicentric trial, 109 PKU patients were randomized to DHA doses from 0 to 7 mg/kg&amp;day for six months. Before and after supplementation, we determined plasma fatty acid concentrations, latencies of visually evoked potentials, fine and gross motor behavior, and IQ. Fatty acid desaturase genotypes were also determined. DHA supplementation increased plasma glycerophospholipid DHA proportional to dose by 0.4% DHA per 1 mg intake/kg bodyweight. Functional outcomes were not associated with DHA status before and after intervention and remained unchanged by supplementation. Genotypes were associated with plasma arachidonic acid levels and, if considered together with the levels of the precursor alpha-linolenic acid, also with DHA. Functional outcomes and supplementation effects were not significantly associated with genotype. DHA intakes up to 7 mg/kg did not improve neurological functions in PKU children. Nervous tissues may be less prone to low DHA levels after infancy, or higher doses might be required to impact neurological functions. In situations of minimal dietary DHA, endogenous synthesis of DHA from alpha-linolenic acid could relevantly contribute to DHA status.",

    "AB": "Background Very little research has been done to simultaneously investigate the effects of Tai Chi (TC) on depression and heart rate variability (HRV). This study, therefore, attempted to explore the effects of TC on depression and on HRV parameters. Methods Sixty older individuals with depression score of 10 or above (the Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS) were randomly assigned into two groups: TC (n = 30) and control group (n = 30). Participants in the experimental group participated in a 24-week TC training program (three 60-min sessions per week), whereas individuals in the control group maintained their unaltered lifestyle. Depression and HRV were measured using the GDS and digital electrocardiogram at baseline and after the 24-week intervention. Results The TC had produced significant positive chances in depression and some HRV parameters (mean heart rate, RMSSD, HF, LFnorm, and HFnorm) (p < 0.05), whereas these positive results were not observed in the control group. Conclusions The results of this study indicated that TC may alleviate depression of the elderly through modulating autonomous nervous system or HRV parameters. This study adds to a growing body of research showing that TC may be effective in treating depression of the elderly. Tai Chi as a mild to moderate mind-body exercise is suitable for older individuals who suffer from depression.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the hemostatic effect of hematostatic agent Surgiflo and absorbable gelatin sponge (AGS) in posterior lumbar surgery. METHODS: A total of 60 cases were recruited during August 2016 and June 2017 according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were randomly allocated to the Surgiflo Haemostatic Matrix (SHM) group or the AGS group (AGS) by computer-generated randomization codes. The success rates of hemostasis for 3 minutes and 5 minutes, the time of operation, the amount of intraoperative bleeding, the volume of autogenously blood transfusion, the amount of blood during hemostasis, the amount of blood transfusion, and BP, RBC, HCT, HB of preoperative, 2 to 3 days, and 5 to 7 days following operation were recorded to compare. Daily drainage and all adverse events after operation were also compared. RESULTS: All the patients were followed up for at least 1 month. The RBC and HCT of the AGS group before operation were lower than those in the control group (P = .039, P = .029), but there was no difference after operation (P >.05). In the control group, 19 cases were successfully hemostatic in 3 minutes, 4 cases were successful in 5 minutes, and 7 cases were combined with hemostasis. In the SHM group, it was 22, 3, and 5 cases respectively. There was significant difference in blood loss during hemostatic process between the 2 groups (P <.001). There was no difference in the amount of blood loss and autologous blood transfusion between the 2 groups, and there was no difference in the operation time between the 2 groups. In the AGS group, allogeneic blood was infused in 1 case during operation, and no allogeneic blood was infused in the other patients. The drainage volume on the 1st day and the 2nd to 4th day after operation in the AGS group was less than that in the control group (P = .015, P = .010). CONCLUSION: Compared with AGS, SHM could decrease the blood loss during hemostatic process and the postoperative drainage volume in posterior operation of lumbar degenerative disease. SHM is a safe and effective hemostatic agent in lumbar posterior surgery.",

    "AB": "PURPOSE: Many studies have demonstrated the advantage of maintaining intraoperative deep neuromuscular block (NMB) with sugammadex. This trial is designed to evaluate the impact of muscle relaxation during laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy on the oncological benefits, particularly in obese patients with gastric cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a double-blind, randomized controlled multicenter prospective trial. Patients with clinical stage I-II gastric cancer with a body mass index of 25 and over, who undergo laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy will be eligible for trial inclusion. The patients will be randomized into a deep NMB group or a moderate NMB group with a 1:1 ratio. A total of 196 patients (98 per group) are required. The primary endpoint is the number of harvested lymph nodes, which is a critical index of the quality of surgery in gastric cancer treatment. The secondary endpoints are surgeon's surgical condition score, patient's sedation score, and surgical outcomes including peak inspiratory pressure, operation time, postoperative pain, and morbidity. DISCUSSION: This is the first study that compares deep NMB with moderate NMB during laparoscopic gastrectomy in obese patients with gastric cancer. We hope to show the oncologic benefits of deep NMB compared with moderate NMB during subtotal gastrectomy.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Total hip replacement (THR) is often accompanied by severe postoperative pain. We aimed to study whether oxycodone can be an effective alternative for fentanyl in the management of early postoperative pain after total hip replacement. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial on 46 patients scheduled to undergo THR. We followed a standard general anesthetic technique, with endotracheal intubation. Twenty minutes before the end of surgery, single bolus injection of fentanyl, 50 mug (fentanyl group [group F], n = 23) or oxycodone, 4 mg (oxycodone group [group O], n = 23) was administered intravenously. Numeric rating scale (NRS) was used to assess pain in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). All patients had intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with 10 mug/kg of fentanyl for 48 hours. Intravenous boluses of 50 mug were administered for breakthrough pain. The cumulative opioid dose administered at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after surgery were recorded. A P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The NRS of group O in the PACU was significantly lower (P <.05); fewer patients in group O required additional fentanyl boluses in the PACU (P <.05). The cumulative opioid requirement was significantly less in group O at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after surgery. (P <.05) CONCLUSIONS:: A single bolus injection of oxycodone is more effective than that of fentanyl in the acute phase of postoperative pain after THR. It may be used as an alternative drug for fentanyl in pain control after orthopedic surgery.",

The view from the tip appears continuously on a portable monitor in the anesthesia area. We evaluated the effectiveness and usefulness of the single/double ETView TVT in monitoring the tracheal tube position during general anesthesia undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy.Eighty-three patients with pulmonary bullae (American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I-III) undergoing lobectomy, with general anaesthesia, were included. Patients were randomly assigned to 3 groups, based on the tube ETView double-lumen tube (VDT), ETView single-lumen tube (VST), or traditional double lumen tube (DT).All 83 patients' intubations were successful to achieve 1-lung ventilation: 74 patients at the first attempt (22/26 in VDT, 26/28 in VST, 26/29 in DT group) and 9 patients at the second attempt. The time to achieve 1-lung ventilation with the VDT was 58.5 +/- 21.5 (mean +/- SD) seconds, the VST was 38.2 +/- 10.1 (mean +/- SD) seconds, and the DT group was 195.5 +/- 40.3 (mean +/- SD) seconds. During operations, the ETView tubes provided continuous airway visualization in all patients; a good view was obtained in 24/25 patients in VDT/VST, moderate in 4/12 patients in VDT/VST, and poor in 1/1 patients in VDT/VST. When the patient left the postanesthesia care unit, all had sore throat and 26/15/25 patients in VDT/VST/DT group had hoarseness. All had good outcomes of the surgical operations.We found the ETView tube to be helpful in the endotracheal intubation and continuous surveillance of tube position in patients with video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy. The ETView single lumen endotracheal tube had fewer associated complications and is superior to the 2 double-lumen tubes.",

    "AB": "PURPOSE: Trachoma, caused by repeated ocular infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide and is targeted for elimination as a public health problem. We sought to determine whether a one-time azithromycin mass treatment would reduce trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) levels below the elimination threshold of 5% in communities with disease prevalence between 5 and 9.9%. METHODS: The study was conducted in 96 sub-village units (balozis) in the Kongwa district of Tanzania which were predicted from prior prevalence surveys to have TF between 5 and 9.9%. Balozis were randomly assigned to the intervention and control arms. The intervention arm received a single mass drug administration of azithromycin. At baseline and 12-month follow-up, ocular exams for trachoma, ocular swabs for detection of chlamydial DNA, and finger prick blood for analysis of anti-chlamydial antibody were taken. RESULTS: Comparison of baseline and 12-month follow-up showed no significant difference in the overall TF1-9 prevalence by balozi between control and treatment arms. In the treatment arm there was a significant reduction of ocular infection 12 months after treatment (p = 0.004) but no change in the control arm. No change in Pgp3-specific antibody responses were observed after treatment in the control or treatment arms. Anti-CT694 responses increased in both study arms (p = 0.009 for control arm and p = 0.04 for treatment arm). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a single round of MDA may not be sufficient to decrease TF levels below 5% when TF1-9 is between 5 and 9.9% at baseline.",

    "AB": "Exhausted cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T cells lose immunological activity due to mitochondrial dysfunction caused by peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC1alpha) inactivation, resulting in a poor prognosis in patients with cancer. As hydrogen gas was recently reported to activate PGC1alpha, the present study investigated whether it restores exhausted CD8+ T cells to improve prognosis in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer. A total of 55 patients with histologically and clinically diagnosed stage IV colorectal carcinoma were enrolled between July 2014 and July 2017. The patients inhaled hydrogen gas for 3 h/day at their own homes and received chemotherapy at the Tamana Regional Health Medical Center (Tamana, Kumamoto, Japan). The CD8+ T cells were isolated from the peripheral blood and their phenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry. It was found that exhausted terminal programmed cell death 1 (PD1)+ CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood are independently associated with worse progressionfree survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Notably, hydrogen gas decreased the abundance of exhausted terminal PD1+ CD8+ T cells, increased that of active terminal PD1 CD8+ T cells, and improved PFS and OS times, suggesting that the balance between terminal PD1+ and PD1 CD8+ T cells is critical for cancer prognosis. Therefore, a novel system for patient classification (category 14) was developed in the present study based on these two indices to assist in predicting the prognosis and therapeutic response. Collectively, the present results suggested that hydrogen gas reverses imbalances toward PD1+ CD8+ T cells to provide an improved prognosis.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of selective brain hypothermia (SBH) in the treatment of neonates with moderate or severe neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), and the effect of SBH treatment on serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and central nervous specific protein S100. METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted. From January 2015 to June 2017, 42 children with moderate to severe HIE in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College were enrolled, and they were randomly divided into SBH treatment group and routine treatment group after obtaining the consent of the guardian of the children. The children in routine treatment group were given the traditional symptomatic supportive treatment, supplemented by drugs to promote nerve cell growth. On the basis of traditional treatment, the children in the SBH treatment group were given SBH treatment within 6 hours after birth. The nasopharyngeal temperature was maintained at 33.0-34.5 centigrade and the rectal temperature was maintained at 34.5-35.0 centigrade. The general clinical data of the two groups including gender, gestational age, birth weight, age, 5-minute neonatal asphyxia score (Apgar score), score for neonatal acute physiology perinatal extension version II (SNAPPE II) were collected. The primary outcomes were hospitalized death, severe disability at 15 months of age, neonatal behavioral neurological assessment (NBNA) score at 28 days of age, and Bayley scales of infant development (BSID) score [including mental development index (MDI) score and psychomotor development index (PDI) score] at 15 months of age at follow-up. The secondary outcomes were serum levels of NSE and S100 protein. The occurrences of adverse events in the two groups were recorded. RESULTS: Among 42 HIE children, 1 child of severe congenital malformation and 1 child of platelet count (PLT) < 50x10(9)/L were excluded, and 40 children were enrolled in the study group. During the follow-up period, 2 children of SBH treatment group and 2 children of routine treatment group were lost or the outcome was unknown. Finally, 18 children of each group were enrolled in the analysis. There was no significant difference in the baseline data of gender, gestational age, birth weight, age, 5-minure Apgar score or SNAPPE II score between the two groups, indicating that the baseline data of the two groups were balanced and comparable. The incidence of severe disability in the SBH treatment group was significantly lower than that in the routine treatment group [5.6% (1/18) vs. 44.4% (8/18), P < 0.05]. There was 1 child death in the routine treatment group and no death in the SBH treatment group. Compared with the routine treatment group, the 28-day NBNA score of the SBH treatment group was increased by 2.9 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 1.0-4.8], BSID score at 15 months of age was improved significantly, MDI score was increased by 11.8 (95%CI = 4.3-19.3), and PDI score was increased by 12.4 (95%CI = 2.5-22.3), with significant differences between the two groups (all P < 0.05). After 3 days of treatment, the serum NSE and S100 protein levels in both groups were significantly decreased as compared with those before treatment [NSE (mug/L): 30.15+/-15.18 vs. 31.32+/-14.75, S100 (ng/L): 387.5 (273.3, 573.0) vs. 890.0 (590.5, 1 162.5) in routine treatment group; NSE (mug/L): 29.09+/-16.22 vs. 32.25+/-15.43, S100 (ng/L): 402.5 (302.2, 580.5) vs. 842.0 (462.3, 1 200.5) in SBH treatment group, all P < 0.05]. There was no significant difference in serum NSE or S100 protein level between the two groups (all P > 0.05). There was no serious adverse event such as arrhythmia, large vein thrombosis or irreducible hypotension in both groups, and there was no significant difference in the incidence of general adverse events such as sinus bradycardia, scleredema, blood glucose disorder, or systemic infection between the two groups [16.7% (3/18) vs. 11.1% (2/18), 5.6% (1/18) vs. 5.6% (1/18), 22.2% (4/18) vs. 11.1% (2/18), 5.6% (1/18) vs. 5.6% (1/18), all P > 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: SBH treatment could significantly increase the NBNA score at 28 days of birth and BSID score at 15 months of age, reduce the incidence of severe disability in moderate and severe HIE children, but it was not be proved that SBH could reduce the mortality. Compared with routine treatment, SBH treatment had no significant superiority on improving the levels of serum NSE and S100 protein, suggesting that SBH could not protect the brain by inhibiting the apoptosis of nerve cells and promoting the repair of nerve cells.",

    "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of aerosol inhalation on respiratory mechanical parameters under different ventilation patterns and ventilator parameters in patients on mechanical ventilation and simulated model of aqualung in vitro. METHODS: (1) Clinical research: the patients needed sedative undergoing mechanical ventilation admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of Qingdao Municipal Hospital from January 2016 to January 2018 were enrolled. They were randomly divided into volume controlled ventilation (VCV) group and pressure controlled ventilation (PCV) group according to random number table. Main parameters setting of respirator: the predetermined tidal volume (VT) was set at 500 mL in the VCV group; the preset pressure was regulated, so that when the atomizer was connected to the atomization device, the VT was nearly equal to or slightly larger than 500 mL in the PCV group. Respiratory mechanical indices [peak airway pressure (Ppeak), inspiratory tidal volume (VTi), exhaled tidal volume (VTe)] were recorded before atomization (atomized oxygen flow was 0) and 10 minutes after the beginning of atomization under the condition of 7 L/min and 9 L/min of atomized oxygen flow respectively. (2) Simulated scuba test in vitro: the ventilator was connected to the simulated scuba, and an external mechanical ventilation model was constructed. They were divided into VCV group and PCV group according to ventilation mode. Main parameters setting of respirator: VCV group was given 450, 550, 650 mL preset VT, and PCV group was given 12, 16, 20 cmH2O (1 cmH2O = 0.098 kPa) preset suction pressure. The changes in respiratory mechanical indexes were observed under different ventilation patterns and ventilator parameters of 0 (only connected with atomizing device), 5, 7, 9 L/min atomizing oxygen flow. RESULTS: (1) Clinical research results: all 77 patients were enrolled in the final analysis, including 20 patients with 7 L/min of atomized oxygen flow under VCV mode, 18 patients with 9 L/min of atomized oxygen flow, and 21 patients with 7 L/min of atomized oxygen flow under PCV mode and 18 patients with 9 L/min of atomized oxygen flow. Under VCV mode, the levels of Ppeak and VTe were increased with the increase in atomized oxygen flow, and there was significant difference at 9 L/min as compared with those before atomization [Ppeak (cmH2O): 29.44+/-4.58 vs. 24.39+/-4.64, VTe (mL): 896.26+/-24.91 vs. 497.61+/-8.67, both P < 0.05]. There was no significant change in VTi, and no significant difference at 9 L/min of atomized oxygen flow as compared with that before atomization (mL: 494.67+/-3.07 vs. 492.61+/-6.05, P > 0.05). Under PCV mode, with the increase in oxygen atomization flow, VTi was decreased gradually, and VTe was increased gradually, with significant difference as compared with those before atomization when the atomized oxygen flow was 9 L/min [VTi (mL): 322.78+/-17.75 vs. 518.17+/-8.97, VTe (mL): 730.89+/-31.20 vs. 519.00+/-9.06, both P < 0.05]. There was no significant change in Ppeak, and no significant difference at 9 L/min of atomized oxygen flow as compared with that before atomization (cmH2O: 21.44+/-2.23 vs. 21.39+/-2.55, P > 0.05). (2) Simulated scuba results in vitro: under VCV mode, VTe monitored by respirator and VT showed by simulated scuba in different preset VT groups were continuously increased with the increase in oxygen atomization flow, while VTi monitored by ventilator was not significantly changed. At 10 minutes after the beginning of atomization, the VTi monitored by ventilator in different preset VT groups was significantly lower than VT showed by simulated water lung (mL: 649.67+/-5.03 vs. 840.00+/-10.00 at 650 mL of preset VT and 9 L/min of atomized oxygen flow, P < 0.05), and VTe was significantly higher than VT showed by simulated water lung (mL: 1 270.33+/-11.06 vs. 840.00+/-10.00 at 650 mL of preset VT and 9 L/min of atomized oxygen flow, P < 0.05). Under PCV mode, with the increase in atomized oxygen flow, VTi monitored by ventilator in different preset suction pressure groups was decreased gradually, and VTe was increased gradually, but Ppeak monitored by ventilator did not changed significantly. At 10 minutes after the beginning of atomization, the VTi monitored by ventilator in different preset suction pressure groups was significantly lower than VT showed by simulated water lung (mL: 917.33+/-4.51 vs. 1 103.33+/-5.77 at 20 cmH2O of preset suction pressure and 9 L/min of atomized oxygen flow, P < 0.05), and VTe was significantly higher than VT showed by simulated water lung (mL: 1 433.33+/-4.73 vs. 1 103.33+/-5.77 at 20 cmH2O of preset suction pressure and 9 L/min of atomized oxygen flow, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Under the VCV mode, the oxygen flow outside the atomization could lead to the increase in VT of the patient side, while under the PCV mode, the VT and Ppeak in the patient side had no significant change. Both VTi and VTe monitored by ventilator could not reflect the patient's VT under either VCV or PCV mode.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Proprietary spearmint extract (PSE) containing a minimum 14.5% rosmarinic acid and 24% total phenolic content, has evinced positive effects on cognition in individuals aged 50-70 with memory impairment after chronic supplementation. To address the growing interest in connecting mental and physical performance, the present study examined whether the nootropic effects of PSE translate into changes in reactive agility following daily supplementation with PSE. METHODS: Utilizing a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design, healthy, recreationally-active men and women (n = 142) received 900 mg of PSE or placebo (PLA) daily for 90 days. Reactive agility, our primary outcome, was determined by measuring the number of hits and average reaction time (ART) on a Makoto Arena II, a 360(0) audio-visual device that measures stationary, lateral, and multi-directional active choice reaction performance. Safety was evaluated using complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and blood lipids. Measurements were evaluated on days 7, 30, and 90 of supplementation. RESULTS: An overall treatment effect (p = 0.019) was evident for increased hits with PSE on the stationary test with footplates, with between group differences at Day 30 (PSE vs. PLA: 28.96 +/- 2.08 vs. 28.09 +/- 1.92 hits; p = 0.040) and Day 90 (PSE vs. PLA: 28.42 +/- 2.54 vs. 27.02 +/- 3.55 hits; p = 0.002). On the same task, ART improved (treatment effect, p = 0.036) with PSE at Day 7 (PSE vs. PLA: 0.5896 +/- 0.060 vs. 0.6141 +/- 0.073 s; p = 0.049) and Day 30 (PSE vs. PLA: 0.5811 +/- 0.068 vs. 0.6033 +/- 0.055 s; p = 0.049). PSE also significantly increased hits (treatment effect, p = 0.020) at Day 30 (PSE vs. PLA: 19.25 +/- 1.84 vs. 18.45 +/- 1.48 hits; p = 0.007) and Day 90 (PSE vs. PLA: 19.39 +/- 1.90 vs. 18.66 +/- 1.64 hits; p = 0.026) for the multi-directional test with footplates. Significant differences were not observed in the remaining Makoto tests. PSE was well tolerated as evidenced by no effects observed in the blood safety panels. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study demonstrate that consumption of 900 mg of PSE improved specific measures of reactive agility in a young, active population.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: We evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a loyalty scheme based intervention involving rewards for increasing physical activity in public sector employees. METHODS: A cluster randomised wait-list controlled trial in public sector organisations in Northern Ireland. We randomly assigned clusters (1:1) using a computer generated random sequence. Researchers were masked to allocation, but participants were not. Employees aged 18-65 years with no self-reported medical contraindications to physical activity were included. The Physical Activity Loyalty Scheme (PAL) intervention was based on high-street loyalty cards where participants earned points for minutes of activity that could be redeemed for rewards, complemented by evidence-based behaviour change techniques. The primary outcome was objectively measured mean steps/day at 6 months using a validated pedometer (Yamax Digi-Walker CW-701) over 7 days, assessed with intention to treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included health, mental wellbeing, quality of life, work absenteeism and presenteeism, and use of healthcare resources. Cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit and mediation analyses were conducted. Trial registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN17975376. RESULTS: Between September 2014 and October 2015, we recruited and randomly assigned 37 clusters (from nine organisations; mean clusters per organisation = four) and 853 participants to the intervention (n = 19 with 457 participants) or control group (n = 18 with 396 participants). Primary outcome data were available for 249 (54.4%) intervention and 236 (59.6%) control participants. Mean steps/day were significantly lower in the intervention vs control group (adjusted mean difference = - 336, 95% CI: -612 to - 60, p = 0.02) at 6 months. Participants redeemed only 39% (SD 43%) of their earned points. Using the Quality Adjusted Life Year outcome, the intervention was not cost effective from an NHS/PSS perspective. A net cost analysis from an employer perspective demonstrated the intervention group was associated with a mean of 2.97 h less absenteeism over a 4 week period (p = 0.62), which could result in net savings ranging from pound66 to pound735 depending on the wage rate employed. At 4-weeks post-baseline there were significant increases in identified regulation, integrated regulation, intrinsic motivation, social norms and intentions in intervention compared to control participants. CONCLUSIONS: Our mixed results pose challenges that are too infrequently exposed in public heath intervention trials. Although the intervention successfully altered several hypothesised mediating constructs it did not translate into long-term behaviour change. Our incentive level may have been too low to incentivise change, despite being designed a priori by a Contingent Valuation Survey. There were also major re-structuring of several organisations which presented significant implementation challenges, and technical limitations.

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Many men have limited knowledge about reproductive health and fertility. The aim of the study was to evaluate if Reproductive Life Plan (RLP)-based counselling during a sexual health visit could increase men's fertility awareness. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was a randomized controlled trial including 201 men aged 18-50 who visited either of two participating sexual health clinics in Sweden for sexually transmitted infection testing during 2014-2016. All men received standard care, and men in the intervention group (IG) also received oral and written RLP-based information about lifestyle and fertility. Awareness about fertility and lifestyle-related factors were the main outcomes, measured through a questionnaire before the intervention and through a telephone survey after three months. Impressions from the counselling were also assessed at follow-up. RESULTS: A majority (71%) of men wanted children in the future. General fertility awareness increased from a mean score of 4.6 to 5.5 out of 12 (P = 0.004) in the IG. The mean number of accurate lifestyle factors (that could affect fertility) mentioned increased from 3.6 to 4.4 (P < 0.001) in the IG. There were no improvements in the control group. Among the men in the IG, 76% had a positive experience of the counselling, and 77% had received new information. CONCLUSION: The intervention managed to increase different aspects of men's fertility awareness. In the future, the format for preconception care for men needs further development. Including men in preconception health policy guidelines and identifying suitable actors for care provision would be important first steps.",

    "AB": "Objective: To investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine on perioperative stress and postoperative pain in patients with radical resection of esophageal cancer under combined thoracoscope and laparoscope. Methods: In this prospective study, one hundred patients undergoing radical resection of esophageal cancer in Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2016 to October 2017, were randomly divided into control group (group C) and dexmedetomidine group (group D), n=50. All patients were anaesthetized (induced and maintained) with intravenous target-controlled infusion(TCl) of propofol and remifentanil, and intermittent intravenous injection of cisatracuriumbesylate. Bispectral index(BIS) was used to monitor the depth of anesthesia and maintained between 45-60 during operation.All patients received sufentanil (0.3 mug/kg) 30 min before the end of the operation and then received intravenous analgesia pump for postoperative patient controlled analgesia(PCA). Patients in group D received intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine(1 mug/kg) 20 min before anesthesia induction, followed by intravenous pumping of dexmedetomidine(0.2 mug.kg(-1).h(-1)) intraoperatively.Postoperative intravenous patient-controlled analgesia(PCA) was performed in all patients, with background doses of sufentanil 0.04 mug. kg(-1).h(-1) for patients in group C, and sufentanil 0.025 mug.kg(-1).h(-1) plus dexmedetomidine 0.1 mug. kg(-1).h(-1) for patients in group D. The operation time, liquid input and output during operation, the number of PCA pressings after operation were recorded. At these time points: T(0)(the day before operation), T(1)(immediate before anesthesia induction), T(2)(1 h after emergence), T(3)(24 h after operation), T(4)(3 d after operation), T(5)(7 d after operation), T(6)(one month after operation), T(7)(3 months after operation) and T(8)(6 month after operation) , venous blood samples of patients were collected for detection of epinephrine, norepinephrine and corticosterone. The pain visual analogue scale(VSA) was used to assess pain levels in patients at T(2), T(3), T(4), T(5), T(6), T(7), T(8). Results: The age, sex ratio, body mass index (BMI) and ASA grading ratio in two groups were not significantly different(all P>0.05). There were no Significant differences in operation time, liquid input and blood output between group C and group D(all P>0.05). Within 24 h after operation, the sufentanil consumption in group D[(35.86+/-8.65)mug]was significantly less than that in group C[(59.53+/-15.26) mug, t=7.061, P<0.05], and the number of PCA pressing in group D(2.15+/-1.38) was obviously less than that in group C(5.85+/-2.16, t=4.971, P<0.05). Compared with group C, serum norepinephrines in group D was significantly less (t=13.276, 16.027, 14.319, 12.771, 12.296, respectively; all P<0.05) at T(1), T(2), T(3), T(4), T(5).And there were no difference between these two groups at T(0), T(6), T(7), T(8)(all P>0.05). Serum epinephrine in group D were significantly lower than them in group C at T(2), T(3), T(4), T(5) (t=6.153, 8.774, 9.127, 8.409, respectively; all P<0.05), but there were no difference between these two groups at T(0), T(1), T(6), T(7), T(8)(all P>0.05). Serum corticosterone in group D were sharply less than them in group C at T(2), T(3), T(4), T(5) (t=16.364, 15.306, 12.153, 12.592, respectively; all P<0.05), but at T(0), T(1), T(6), T(7), T(8), there were no difference between these two groups (all P>0.05). Compared with group C, the number of patients with postoperative pain(VAS score>/=4) in group D was obviously less at T(6), T(7), T(8)(10 vs 20, 4 vs 12, 3 vs 10; chi(2)=4.762, 4.762, 4.332, respectively; all P<0.05). Conclusion: Perioperative application of dexmedetomidine can effectively decrease the perioperative stress response, obviously cut down the perioperative opioid consumption, and prevent the transition from postoperative acute pain to chronic pain in patients with radical resection of esophageal cancer under combined thoracoscope and laparoscope.",

Methods: This was a prospective study conducted from November 2017 to March 2018. Sixty patients, aged 50-70, undergoing elective surgery for unilateral lower extremity varicose vein at Ningbo No.2 Hospital, with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade or , were enrolled and randomly allocated to two groups (n=30), general anesthesia group and spinal anesthesia group. On the first day before surgery, the patient's general data were collected and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) was used to assess the patient's sleep status in the past month. The postoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and pulse oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) in the ward were recorded with a multi-function monitor on first night after surgery. The total sleep time and arousal time were obtained by bispectral index (BIS) monitoring from 20: 00 (the first day) to 6: 00 (the second day). Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) was recorded at 18: 00 at the second day after surgery. Results: There was no significant difference in general data and PSQI scale scores between the two groups of patients (all P>0.05). And there were no significant differences in MAP, HR, SpO(2) and BIS every 2 hours between the two groups from 20: 00 (the first day) to 6: 00 (the second day)(all P>0.05). Compared with the general anesthesia group, the first night of total sleep time in the spinal anesthesia group was significantly shorter[(357.2+/-83.4)min vs (275.1+/-64.8)min, t=-9.635, P<0.05], while the rate of wakefulness, total sleep time, overall sleep quality, daytime mood and daytime physical function were significantly higher[(25.9%, 22.2%, 25.9%, 18.5%18.5%) vs (51.7%, 51.7%, 55.2%, 48.3%44.8%), chi(2)=3.901, 5.192, 4.941, 5.523 and 4.437, all P<0.05], and the cases of postoperative urinary retention and lower limb discomfort were significantly higher[(8 and 6) vs (1 and 0), all P<0.05]. Conclusion: Both anesthesia methods can be safely and effectively applied to middle-aged and elderly patients with lower extremity varicose veins surgery, but patients with general anesthesia show fewer adverse reactions on the first night after surgery and have better sleep quality.",

Methods: A total of 114 T2DM inpatients or outpatients, including 46 males and 68 females aged (55+/-14) years between January 2015 and January 2016 were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (n=57) only with hypoglycemic agents, and the intervention group (n=57) with berberine (0.4 g, 3 times a day) on the basis of treatment from the control group. Both groups were treated and followed up for six months. All the clinical and biochemical parameters were routinely evaluated before and after treatment. And the safety of berberine was assessed. Results: After the treatment, the improvement of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), systolic pressure (SP), high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), rythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in the intervention group were significantly better than those in the control group (all P<0.05), as well as the UACR[47(26, 120) mg/g vs 103(42, 267) mg/g, P<0.001]and serum Cys C[(0.83+/-0.30) mg/L vs (0.98+/-0.25) mg/L, P=0.031]. However, there was no statistically significant difference of UACR and Cys C between before and after treatment in the control group (all P>0.05). Compared to the control group, the patients in the intervention group had lesser UACR[47(26, 120) mg/g vs 68(28, 158) mg/g, P=0.039], and lower serum Cys C[(0.83+/-0.30) mg/L vs (0.96+/-0.30)mg/L, P=0.041]. Berberine had no obvious adverse effects. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the berberine administration was independently associated with the reduction of UACR (beta=-0.051, P=0.041) and Cys C (beta=-0.068, P=0.033) in T2DM patients. Conclusion: Berberine improves diabetic kidney disease by reducing UACR and serum Cys C in T2DM patients, and it was safe.",

    "AB": "Background and Objectives: The authors sought to assess the effect of the use of a new crosslinked hyaluronan (NCH) gel on the prevention of intrauterine adhesions (IUAs) in women underwent curettage in the second trimester. Methods: Between June 2016 and September 2017, 60 patients who underwent curettage for retained placental tissue after medically induced or spontaneous pregnancy loss in the second trimester were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: Group 1 patients received curettage plus NCH gel (intervention group), and group 2 patients received curettage alone (control group). The main outcomes were the rate and severity of IUA formation, which were assessed by follow-up hysteroscopy performed in the ensuing 2-6 months. Results: The hysteroscopic findings were available for 20 patients in group 1 and 28 patients in group 2. IUAs were observed in 6 patients in group 2, while no IUAs was observed in group 1 (P = .007). IUAs were staged as mild in 4 patients (14.28%) and moderate in 2 patients (7.14%) in group 2 according to the American Fertility Society classification of IUAs. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that NCH gel appears to be able to reduce the formation of IUAs in women who undergo curettage in the second trimester, although larger controlled, randomized, multicenter studies are needed to confirm these results.",

    "AB": "BACKGROUND: Based on the encouraging activity and manageable safety profile observed in a phase 1 study, the ECHELON-2 trial was initiated to compare the efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (A+CHP) versus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) for the treatment of CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphomas. METHODS: ECHELON-2 is a double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, placebo-controlled, active-comparator phase 3 study. Eligible adults from 132 sites in 17 countries with previously untreated CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphomas (targeting 75% with systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either A+CHP or CHOP for six or eight 21-day cycles. Randomisation was stratified by histological subtype according to local pathology assessment and by international prognostic index score. All patients received cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m(2) and doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each cycle intravenously and prednisone 100 mg once daily on days 1 to 5 of each cycle orally, followed by either brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg and a placebo form of vincristine intravenously (A+CHP group) or vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2) and a placebo form of brentuximab vedotin intravenously (CHOP group) on day 1 of each cycle. The primary endpoint, progression-free survival according to blinded independent central review, was analysed by intent-to-treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01777152. FINDINGS: Between Jan 24, 2013, and Nov 7, 2016, 601 patients assessed for eligibility, of whom 452 patients were enrolled and 226 were randomly assigned to both the A+CHP group and the CHOP group. Median progression-free survival was 48.2 months (95% CI 35.2-not evaluable) in the A+CHP group and 20.8 months (12.7-47.6) in the CHOP group (hazard ratio 0.71 [95% CI 0.54-0.93], p=0.0110). Adverse events, including incidence and severity of febrile neutropenia (41 [18%] patients in the A+CHP group and 33 [15%] in the CHOP group) and peripheral neuropathy (117 [52%] in the A+CHP group and 124 [55%] in the CHOP group), were similar between groups. Fatal adverse events occurred in seven (3%) patients in the A+CHP group and nine (4%) in the CHOP group. INTERPRETATION: Front-line treatment with A+CHP is superior to CHOP for patients with CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphomas as shown by a significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival with a manageable safety profile.
