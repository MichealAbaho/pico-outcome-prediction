# pico-outcome-prediction
Detecting outcomes from clinical records for evidence based practice.

The goal of the project is to identify and extract outcome phrases from medical text i.e. spans of text designated to be health outcomes as described by the Comet and Cochrnae Institutions. Outcomes are essentially a diagnosis measured by clinical researchers during Clinical Trials. In Evidence based care or practice, clinicians and biomedics assess the impact new interventions have on these outcomes and therefore establish a new intervention if results are determined to be significant.
